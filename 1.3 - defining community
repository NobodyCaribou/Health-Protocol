- For 10 consecutive days, commit to random acts of kindness in your immediated surroundings.
  For an easy and very fullfilling example: leave a small note at your neighbor's door with 
  wishes for a good day. Or get elaborate and bake something for them, leave a plant, flowers or something else of beauty. 
  Be anonymous if you like or happily announce yourself. Have fun.
