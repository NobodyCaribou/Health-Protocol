Experiments (nano to macro)

- Define community for yourself (write in log)
- Ask close friends/family how they define community
- reflection: How do I currently get my community nutrients?
- List your layers of community in a visual diagram
- Start a conversation with a stranger in your local community
- Organize a community health discussion

- Meditation: for the next 10 days, make a specific time to sit in silence for 1-3 minutes. Record in your log how it goes.
- Beam Experiment: 

Once your student pack arrives you can get to work on mastering a series of balance beam progressions (if you already have a beam you can get started right away instead off waiting for your student pack)
All progressions must be completed with a forward gaze (ie. not looking down at your feet) and must be started and finished under control. 

The key with beam progressions is (like anything else) consistency. 

If you get foot pain when on the beam then you have some foot mobility work to do before putting in reps but aside from that, practice everyday for short periods and you will be surprised at how quickly progress comes. 
Balance work can often be a bigger mental challenge than physical. Calm your mind, focus on your breath and body position and it will help in a big way. 

a) Single leg balance for 60 seconds per side. 
- Standing on 1 leg, balance for 60 seconds without making an error (looking forward, not down. Completed for both legs)


b) Ten leg switches. 
- Go from standing on your Left foot to standing on your Right foot, complete 10 switches under control with a second or two pause between each switch.
