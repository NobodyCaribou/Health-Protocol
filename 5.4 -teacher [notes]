Lesson 28 - Relationships

------ Intro: 

Hello beautiful nerds and welcome to lesson 28 where we will be covering the topic of relationships

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

Our objective todat is to expand perspective on the topic of relationship (breadth and depth) and to share our understanding

To stimulate curiosity and deeper inquiry/examination of our individual relationships

If you have questions about the lesson, feel free to message us or create a community discussion around the topic on Slack

Let's dig in.


------ Intro

- Sub-topic of community

- Health is the relationship we have with ourselves
- Human life is built on a foundation of relationships to our world
- Relationships require energy. Proof of work


------ What are relationships?

Before we start - pause this and answer two questions in your log: 

1) What is a relationship?
2) What relationships are most important in my life?

Relationship: the way in which two or more people or things are connected. The state of being connected

Very broad term. Every person or thing we interact with implies a relationship. Some are fleeting and superficial, some are enduring and deep


------ Types of relationships

- Relationship with ourselves (our cells, our minds, our bodies)
- Friendship
- Parent/child (family relationship)
- Intimate/romantic
- Nature
- Casual
- relationship with technology


------ Depth vs breadth

- Depth = intimacy (sexual and non sexual). "Into me see" - risky. reciprocation of disclosure. non judgemental
- deep relationships are energy intensive and require commitment and flexibility 

- Breadth = expansiveness of our web



------- Quality of relationships

- Auditing our relationships
- Nourishing relationships



------ Healthy vs. Unhealthy relationships

- Always contextual and subjective
- Defining healthy relationship
- Defining unhealthy relationship

- Components of healthy relationships: honesty, mutual commitment
- Does the relationship align with my values/aspirations in life or health?
- Being able to disagree in good faith, offer feedback without it being taken personally
- Challenging one another to detect blind spots, to grow 
- Open communication without fear of judgement





Experiments:
- If you really knew me (depth)
- Write down 5 relationships you cherish most
- One relationship you want to improve, how you can improve it
