5.3 - Stress

teachers: Malin & Nick

- Defining stress
- Types of stress (eustress - adaptive stress)
- Duration and intensity
- Mental stress
- Autoregulation
- Self awareness & values


Nick raw notes:
- Shortage of food was an ancestral stressor. Now surplus of food is a stressor
- Stress isn't the problem, chronic stress is the issue
- Inflammation is a healing response to stress. It is good but should be acute, not chronic
- PTSD / PTG
- Stress can be an adaptive input for resilience or it can cause disease
- Quantity & perception of stress
- mental training reduces mental stress
- Small amount of training = huge decrease in stress
- Values: deciding what is worth stressing about. Unimportant things don't call for us getting stressed
- Controlling future modeling (stressing about things that haven't happened and usually don't end up happening)
- Presence: the antidote for stress. Calm breathing is a potent tool
- Not sleeping is stressful for the body
- Not moving is stressful for the body and mind
- Eating food products is highly stressful for the body
- Compulsive thinking is highly stressful on the body
- Doing squats is mildly stressful on the body
- Running 20km can be mildly or highly stressful on the body (depends on the person)
- Constantly being on social media is highly stressful for our bodies and minds

Malin additional notes:
- Stress is always physical - when it becomes mental, you've let it go too (?) far. But we do not recognize the stiff shoulders and hurting knee as stress.
And stress research is usually done by psychologists - as if it is a mental response. But long before that it is physical - and when we dont listen long 
enough, it gets mental - the brains way of telling us to shut down
- The lion analogy - recovering so much that when you need to stress, you can handle it
- Usually, the amount of stress is not the biggest problem, it is the lack of recovery and resting (which should be the normal state of mind)
- How little effort can you put into something and still get the same results (physical examples, historical examples)
- Managing stress by adding "stress management activities" might be counter productive - remove instead of adding
- Stress management needs to be learned when NOT stressed, so that it is in your bones when you actually get stressed (like fire fighters practicing). 
And maybe we should not learn to manage stress, but to feel and recognize when we are stressed, and listen to that response
- Stress shuts of the ability to feel - that's the whole purpose of the response (when being chased by a lion etc) - but in order to be able to manage stress, 
you need to feel what the body needs. That's why we are so poor at handling stressed when we are stressed...
- Stress is essentially worrying about things that might happen in the future - staying in the present moment is a way to practice not stressing (Eckhart Tolle - the Power of Now)
- Stress and the immune system and how it all adds upp (burn out very common when people go on vacation and the body gets a chance to relax and recover)
- Technical analogy - stress tests of materials - to evaluate the maximum load they can handle, but not expected to be under that load all the time
- Slow breathing when physically challenged - excellent way to train the nervous system to cope with stress
- Identifying your own healthy signals of stress - like stiffening shoulders, breathing in top of lungs, being irritable, forgetting to eat, ignoring tiredness etc
- Music is the space between the notes - Claude Debussy --> without pause and rhytm, we cannot create the flow. And we need emptiness and space in order to be 
able to feel what we need 
- Changing the starting point - instead of trying to adapt the homo sapiens to a modern society, we could benefit from focusing on being homo sapiens and 
needs of that species.
- Stress is not a response to outer events, but our reaction and inner demand on those events - means we can work on changing that. And realising we cannot
controll a lot of things, and historically couldn't either.


------ Intro:

Hello beautiful humans

Welcome to lesson 5.3

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

In this lesson Malin and I are covering the concept of stress

If you have questions about the lesson or want to contribute resources or a layer 2 conversation, please message us on slack

Let's dig in


------ Defining stress

What is stress? (for listeners: pause right now and write down your definition of stress before hearing ours and expanding your understanding)

Malins definition: A physical, inner reaction to demands (physical/mental/emotional/spiritual) imposed by inner or outer factors, that should be temporary but 
can be chronic if not acknowledged as something that should be temporary

Nicks definition: A state of tension (physical/mental/emotional/spiritual) created by challenging circumstances. 

Stress = potential output response to a challenge. Often associated with a negative connotation (being harmed/overwhelmed by stress) 

different uses/contexts for the term

cultural acceptance of stress and the connection to the natural state


------ Types of stress (eustress - adaptive stress)

Healthy vs. unhealthy stress (how to differentiate)

Variables to consider (duration and intensity covered next)

Eustress

Role of perception


------ Duration and intensity

Duration: How long is a stress applied for?

Acute stressors are natural. Chronic stressors are unnatural

System resilience

Window of adaptation (overwhelm/failure points)

Intensity defined


------ Mental stress

All events are neutral until we judge them

Perception is everything - Serenity prayer

Hero vs victim mindset

All mental stress is self inflicted

Stressing over things that have not and might not happen


------ Autoregulation

Controlled exposure to stressors

Building resilience and confidence in ability to cope with stressful situations by intentionally exposing yourself to 
stressors in order to achieve adaptations

Body literacy, listening to signals, realising that the physical signals are there much earlier than the mental signals


------ Self awareness & values

Am I getting stressed about things unecessarily?

Am I aware of times when my system is being overwhelmed with stress? Am I aware of my "healthy signals" of stress - i.e. the physical signs that 
should make my pay attention and take action? Do I take action to reduce stress or add more?

What is worth worrying about (what are my values? what truly matters to me?) - having distance to your own worries (for example the worry stone)


------- Experiments: 

- How do you define stress?
- How do you recognize that you are stressed (physical, mental, emotional signals)?
- Write down a recent stressful experience and how you responded to it
- What is currently you biggest worry? Is it something worth worrying about? Can you take action to mitigate the concern? If yes, what action?
- For 7 days, stress your physical system to achieve a desired adaptation (ex: run, breath holds, cold/hot exposure, squat to failure)
- For 7 days - try doing the things you do with as little effort as possible and still achieving the same results (ex relax shoulders when in front of computer, 
balance on one leg and explore which muscles that can actually relax and mainating position)
- Write down 3 ways you stress yourself physically or mentally in order to build resilience
- Reflect on which demands you put on yourself that stress you, and if they are really true, or if you can change that
