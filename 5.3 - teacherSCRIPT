- Duration and intensity
- Mental stress
- Autoregulation
- Self awareness & values


Malin additional notes:
- Stress is always physical - when it becomes mental, you've let it go too (?) far. But we do not recognize the stiff shoulders and hurting knee as stress.
And stress research is usually done by psychologists - as if it is a mental response. But long before that it is physical - and when we dont listen long 
enough, it gets mental - the brains way of telling us to shut down
- The lion analogy - recovering so much that when you need to stress, you can handle it
- Usually, the amount of stress is not the biggest problem, it is the lack of recovery and resting (which should be the normal state of mind)
- How little effort can you put into something and still get the same results (physical examples, historical examples)
- Managing stress by adding "stress management activities" might be counter productive - remove instead of adding
- Stress management needs to be learned when NOT stressed, so that it is in your bones when you actually get stressed (like fire fighters practicing). 
And maybe we should not learn to manage stress, but to feel and recognize when we are stressed, and listen to that response
- Stress shuts of the ability to feel - that's the whole purpose of the response (when being chased by a lion etc) - but in order to be able to manage stress, 
you need to feel what the body needs. That's why we are so poor at handling stressed when we are stressed...
- Stress is essentially worrying about things that might happen in the future - staying in the present moment is a way to practice not stressing (Eckhart Tolle - the Power of Now)
- Stress and the immune system and how it all adds upp (burn out very common when people go on vacation and the body gets a chance to relax and recover)
- Technical analogy - stress tests of materials - to evaluate the maximum load they can handle, but not expected to be under that load all the time
- Slow breathing when physically challenged - excellent way to train the nervous system to cope with stress
- Identifying your own healthy signals of stress - like stiffening shoulders, breathing in top of lungs, being irritable, forgetting to eat, ignoring tiredness etc
- Music is the space between the notes - Claude Debussy --> without pause and rhytm, we cannot create the flow. And we need emptiness and space in order to be 
able to feel what we need 
- Changing the starting point - instead of trying to adapt the homo sapiens to a modern society, we could benefit from focusing on being homo sapiens and 
needs of that species.
- Stress is not a response to outer events, but our reaction and inner demand on those events - means we can work on changing that. And realising we cannot
controll a lot of things, and historically couldn't either.


------ Intro:

Hello beautiful humans and welcome to lesson 27

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

In this lesson Malin and I are going to share our perspectives on stress and unpack some nuance as it relates to health

If you have questions about the lesson, want to contribute resources or share a layer 2 conversation, please message us on slack


------ Intro, defining stress

When exploring concepts a good place to start is by defining terms and I think this is especially important with stress

Simplistic cultural relationship with stress. Stress is often viewed as bad, and cited as a major cause of mortality

The belief that stress is bad for us is harmful, but stress in iteself is neutral and not necessarily bad for us

Goal of today: Share a broad perspective on stress, bring nuance to an often binary topic 

What is stress? (for listeners: pause right now and write down your definition of stress before hearing ours and expanding your understanding)

Malins definition: A physical, inner reaction to demands (physical/mental/emotional/spiritual) imposed by inner or outer factors, that should be temporary but 
can be chronic if not acknowledged as something that should be temporary

Nicks definition: A state of tension (physical/mental/emotional/spiritual) created by challenging circumstances

Stress = potential output response to a challenge

Different uses/contexts for the term

Cultural acceptance of stress and the connection to the natural state


------ Types of stress (acute, chronic, eustress)

Dose determines harm/benefit. Healthy/unhealthy dose of stress is contextual to the individual. 
Inflammation is a healing response to stress. Adaptive or mal-adaptive depends on intensity, duration and capacity of individual

Healthy vs. unhealthy stress (how to differentiate)

Variables to consider (duration and intensity covered next)

Eustress - greek prefix "eu" meaning "good"
adaptive stress, beneficial, consistent exposure builds resilience. A tree needs wind to build strength. PTSD vs PTG
Opposite of distress. Has a beneficial impact on health whereas distress has a negative one
Can induce a state of flow - a focused state created by a healthy dose of challenge
Challenge: transform distress into eustress. Perception and mindset

Role of perception (all events/circumstances are neutral until we place a judgement on them. The practice of perceiving all events as good for us)

Historic vs. modern stressors. Food (too little/too much). Technology. Movement

- Consistently poor sleep is stressful for the body
- Not moving is stressful for the body and mind
- Eating food products is highly stressful for the body. Fasting vs. starving - adaptive vs. mal-adaptive
- Compulsive thinking is highly stressful on the body
- Doing squats is mildly stressful on the body
- Running 20km can be mildly or highly stressful on the body (depends on the person)
- Constantly being on social media is highly stressful for our bodies and minds


------ Duration and intensity

Duration: How long is a stress applied for? 

Acute stressors are natural. Chronic stressors are unnatural

System resilience

Window of adaptation (overwhelm/failure points)

Intensity defined


------ Mental stress

It seems like most of the stress we encounter today as modern humans is mental stress

All events are neutral until we judge them

Perception is everything - Serenity prayer (God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can
and the wisdom to know the difference

Serenity: the state of being calm, peaceful and untroubled

Hero vs. victim mindset

All mental stress is self inflicted

Stressing over things that have not, might not (and usually don't) happen

Compulsive thinking is stressful. Mental training reduces compulsive thinking

Presence: the antidote for stress. Calm breathing is a potent tool

Physical manifestations of mental stress. Changing your mind about stress can change your body's response to stress


------ Autoregulation

Knowing our limits by mindfully testing them

Controlled exposure to stressors

Building resilience and confidence in ability to cope with stressful situations by intentionally exposing yourself to 
stressors in order to achieve adaptations

Body literacy, listening to signals, realising that the physical signals are there much earlier than the mental signals


------ Self awareness & values

Values: deciding what is worth stressing about. Unimportant things don't call for us getting stressed

Am I getting stressed about things unecessarily?

Am I aware of times when my system is being overwhelmed with stress? Am I aware of my "healthy signals" of stress - i.e. the physical signs that 
should make my pay attention and take action? Do I take action to reduce stress or add more?

What is worth worrying about? (what are my values? what truly matters to me?) - having distance to your own worries (for example the worry stone)

------- Experiments: 

- How do you define stress?
- How do you recognize that you are stressed (physical, mental, emotional signals)?
- Write down a recent stressful experience and how you responded to it
- What is currently you biggest worry? Is it something worth worrying about? Can you take action to mitigate the concern? If yes, what action?
- For 7 days, stress your physical system to achieve a desired adaptation (ex: run, breath holds, cold/hot exposure, squat to failure)
- For 7 days - try doing the things you do with as little effort as possible and still achieving the same results (ex relax shoulders when in front of computer, 
balance on one leg and explore which muscles that can actually relax and mainating position)
- Write down 3 ways you stress yourself physically or mentally in order to build resilience
- Reflect on which demands you put on yourself that stress you, and if they are really true, or if you can change that
