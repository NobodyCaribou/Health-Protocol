- Defining stress
- Types of stress (eustress - adaptive stress)
- Duration and intensity
- Mental stress
- Autoregulation
- Self awareness & values


Nick raw notes:
- Shortage of food was an ancestral stressor. Now surplus of food is a stressor
- Stress isn't the problem, chronic stress is the issue
- Inflammation is a healing response to stress. It is good but should be acute, not chronic
- PTSD / PTG
- Stress can be an adaptive input for resilience or it can cause disease
- Quantity & perception of stress
- mental training reduces mental stress
- Small amount of training = huge decrease in stress
- Values: deciding what is worth stressing about. Unimportant things don't call for us getting stressed
- Controlling future modeling (stressing about things that haven't happened and usually don't end up happening)
- Presence: the antidote for stress. Calm breathing is a potent tool
- Not sleeping is stressful for the body
- Not moving is stressful for the body and mind
- Eating food products is highly stressful for the body
- Compulsive thinking is highly stressful on the body
- Doing squats is mildly stressful on the body
- Running 20km can be mildly or highly stressful on the body (depends on the person)
- Constantly being on social media is highly stressful for our bodies and minds


------ Intro:

Hello beautiful humans

Welcome to lesson 5.3

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

In this lesson Malin and I are covering the concept of stress

If you have questions about the lesson or want to contribute resources or a layer 2 conversation, please message us on slack

Let's dig in


------ Defining stress

What is stress? (for listeners: pause right now and write down your definition of stress before hearing ours and expanding your understanding)

Malins definition:

Nicks definition: 

different uses/contexts for the term


------ Types of stress (eustress - adaptive stress)

Healthy vs. unhealthy stress (how to differentiate)

Variables to consider (duration and intensity covered next)

Eustress

Role of perception


------ Duration and intensity

Duration: How long is a stress applied for?

Acute stressors are natural. Chronic stressors are unnatural

System resilience

Window of adaptation (overwhelm/failure points)

Intensity defined


------ Mental stress

All events are neutral until we judge them

Perception is everything

Hero vs victim mindset

All mental stress is self inflicted

Stressing over things that have not and might not happen


------ Autoregulation

Controlled exposure to stressors

Building resilience by intentioally exposing yourself to stressors in order to achieve adaptations

Body literacy, listening to signals


------ Self awareness & values

Am I getting stressed about things unecessarily?

Am I aware of times when my system is being overwhelmed with stress? Do I take action to reduce stress or add more?

What is worth worrying about (what are my values? what truly matters to me?)


------- Experiments: 

- How do you define stress?
- Write down a recent stressful experience and how you responded to it
- What is currently you biggest worry? Is it something worth worrying about? Can you take action to mitigate the concern? If yes, what action?
- For 7 days, stress your physical system to achieve a desired adaptation (ex: run, breath holds, cold/hot exposure, squat to failure)
- Write down 3 ways you stress yourself physically or mentally in order to build resilience
