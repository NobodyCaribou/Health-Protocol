Layer 2 conversation between Ruth & Nick. Topic: Proof of work health log

-------

Today Ruth and I are having a layer 2 conversation about a seemingly small but incredibly powerful element of the Foot Nerd experience: pow health log 

We want to answer the big 3: what is the pow health log? why is it important? how does it help?

We're also going to share some thoughts about the concept of proof of work and how it carries meaning in our own lives

-------

Proof: A document used to show that something is true
Work: An activity involving mental or physical effort done in order to achieve a purpose or result

FNE context: Proof that demonstrates you have allocated energy (effort) to your health process

Proof of work health log: Daily documentation of your health process. An intentional health journal. A tiny habit. A ritual


Why? - because it's helpful to have a tool to hold ourselves accountable and to collect data which can be processed for insights

How? - By recording what you did, experiment results, insights, lessons, challenges, wins

What? - A daily journal to log your health process. A daily journalling ritual related to what you are doing and learning related to Health

[Ruth thoughts]


[Nick thoughts]
- Health is proof of work. Expanded: my current state of health is proof of the work I have put into the process of improving my health
- My mental health is proof of work. my fitness level is proof of work. My understanding of something is proof of work. Proof of learning
- My ability to play an instrument is proof of the work I have put into learning that instrument

- Writing in your pow health log is a daily ritual and proof that you showed up each day for 360 consecutive days to take care of yourself
- Health is about clarity and momentum
- To me, the pow health log is the tiny habit that builds momentum and facilitates clarity
- It's the anchor habit/ritual that helps us continue making process
- Unsure what to do today? read your entries from the past few days, review the lesson framework and write down some thoughts

Hard to wake up this morning, will work to improve PM routine and calm my mind tonight
5 min meditation was hard today. Busy mind
Went for a 45min walk, much clearer when back home
Explored squat position for 5 min

Tip of the day: consciously respond to the world instead of reacting to it
