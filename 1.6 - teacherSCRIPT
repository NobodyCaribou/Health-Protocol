------ Intro: [speaker]

Hello beautiful foot nerds

Welcome to lesson 1.6

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

Today's lesson is about unpacking what it means to intentionally design the journey ahead

If you have questions about the lesson or want to contribute resources or a layer 2 conversation, please message us on slack

Let's dig in.



------ Clarify of purpose

Why are you doing this?

What is the purpose that will motivate you when things get challenging?




------ Values

What are your values?

What matters to you and how does that align with this journey


------ Planning

Create a calendar (progress checklist)

Contingency planning: what happens if you have a setback? what happens if you lose focus? Who can you look to for support?

Plan B: Go for a 45 minute walk and write about what was going through your mind, feelings, emotions, stressors

Float day?

Deals with yourself: I don't watch netflix until i've worked on my health for an hour


------ Prompts

Design reminders

Phone prompts, object/environment prompts


------ Setting hard boundaries

When is your hour?

Tell other people about it, why it's important and not to interrupt you



------ Defining traction

Traction: forward motion towards your objective

Dis-traction: slipping away from your objective

Clearly define traction so it's easy to spot distraction

Traction: Show up for 1 hour per day for 360 days

Enables detection of distraction (scrolling IG instead of doing your hour that day = distraction)
