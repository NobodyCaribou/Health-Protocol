"If you really knew me, you would know that..." it could be anything
examples, "...you would know that I'm really having a hard time with...." or "I'm excited..." or "...sad becausee"
And then allow for 60-90 seconds for the other person to share theirs. You don't have to comment or discuss the share if 
you don't want to. Just the exercise alone is valuable for connection, listening and building trust.
