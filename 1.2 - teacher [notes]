------ Intro:

Hello to everyone listening and welcome to the Foot Nerd Program. 

I’m Nick [and I’m Ruth] and we're honored to welcome you to lesson 1.2 

thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

in order to improve our health we first need to define health and develop a shared definition of what health means. That's the objective for lesson 1.2

If you have questions about the lesson, feel free to message us on Slack and if you want to contribute you can submit a pull request on github. 

Let's dig in.


------ Defining health for yourself

Health is subjective. Everyone will have their own definition and thats a good thing. As an experiment for this lesson, pause this right now and write down your
definition of health in your log. It's a really insightful exercise and gives you a reference point to check back on as you continue learning. 

In my experience I've found my definition to be very dynamic and flexible. A definition that shifts over time as my understanding expands

[Ruth's definition of health]
- the full recognition that I have everything I need inside my own brain and body to adapt, problem solve and navigate the everchanging world around me with enthusiasm and vitality
- I understand how to access the full pharmacy inside my own brain and body so that I am not dependent on medications, electronics, drinkables, smokeables, combustibles or edibles 
in order to participate fully in my life and within my community.
- short term, the quality of my life is satisfying, long term, if I get to stay here til I am old, I will not be a burden to the people I love and care about 
- and I will not take an unnecessary bed in a hospital overtaxing the medical institutions.

[Ruth - some extra notes on the "Health" definition
My extended definition of health related to the pillars
- the love of deep nourishing and delicious sleep/rest/meditatation
- if I feed it food, not too much, mostly plants 
- if I am playfully enjoying regular and also useful movement (think gardening and carrying groceries) all through the day 
- and if I am connected to other humans who are pursuing the same.


Nick's definition of health: the process of learning how to take better care of myself and prioritizing energy towards making small daily adjustments.

To me, health is:
- proof of work
- a process of exploration
- my most important job
- a birthright
- an inside job (nobody can make you healthy except yourself)
- what makes time valuable


------ Mighty community definitions

Every member who joins our mighty network answers a few questions in order to join. One of those questions is: "how do you define health in a single sentence"?

We ask this to everyone with the aim to learn how others define health and also to provide us with data that we can use to tease out common threads/principles

Ruth and I have each picked our favourite 3 submissions from Mighty community members:

[Ruths 3]
- A high quality of life made as simple as possible [Chase Tucker]
- The ability to recover and adapt well to stress [Brad Johns]
- The ability to feel and identify how I am at any point. In other words, "know thy self" [Beth Peltier]
- I asked my spouse and he said this: "A peace that surpasses all understanding" - [Matthew Gervase]

(NickyPop, I didn't read yours before I chose mine and we picked 2 of the same ones! :)

Nick's 3:
- Having the ability to be physically and mentally ready for any and all life events [Alex Cumblad]
- The ability to recover from and adapt well to stress [Brad Johns]
- Our natural state [Evan Maxwell]
- The ability to sense, feel and identify how I am at any point, in other words, "know thy self" [Beth Peltier]

Common threads: absence of disease, mental, physical and spiritual components, balance, the ability to do what we want. 


------- Health as process, not a destination

Common misperception: health is a look or a destination. Once you get there you're done

reality: health is an ongoing process, not a destination

many paths to take, none are necessarily right/wrong but there are more efficient and less efficient paths one can take

[Ruth] 
- often the shifting path of health changes based on our age and experiences in life
- if we allow ourselves to stop and check in with how our bodies feel, the thoughts we think and our habits, we naturally enter the river of change
- seems a natural part of our human lives to allow for health to emerge if we don't have our attention and energy hijacked by the larger world around us.

a process of continual mindful exploration
[Ruth]
- had to look up the definition of "mindful" 
- one of those words I take for granted that I know the meaning of
- have a couple of good ones, NickyPop.

balance of exploration and (informational) exploitation

Exploration: trying new things, generating new data, playing with a wide variety of inputs

Exploitation: the action of making use of and benefitting from information. Applying lessons you learn when exploring

Example: 

exploration with food - try out different monthly food experiments (what food, when, monitor energy and mood, poops)

explaoitation: review notes, discover what foods make you feel best, make use of that information to change what/how/when you eat

[Ruth]
- I'm not sure of what this means, chef. But I trust you'll lead and I'll follow :) 


------ Continuum of responsibility

It’s easy to get constantly distracted and forfeit responsibility
[Ruth}
- it seems this may have something to do with a crisis of time or timing- if we don't have ample time to know what we need to thrive, 
it's easy to give over to others who will happily take responsibility, but there is a price to pay for that. 


It’s work to remain focused and claim full responsibility
[Ruth]
-we must create time and space and protect the time and the space to decide for ourselves

Avoiding responsibility is easy, convenient, comfortable, but is unlikely to lead to health. Seeking to blame others/circumstances you cannot modify

Example: My knee hurts so I'm going to blame my age, my crappy body, and im going to find someone to fix it for me


Accepting full responsibility looks something like this:

Assumption: my body works perfectly until I cause it problems. Therefore, if someone is wrong, I ask what I'M doing to cause it before seeking external reasons

Objective: moving along the continuum from zero to full responsibility. A mindset


------ A lifelong process

Think of FNP as an initiation into your health process

A framework designed to help you define health, learn fundamental principles and enagage in experiments with community

Basic training to acquire tools, defence strategies

FNP as a kickstart to begin your health process so you have tools for a lifetime



------ Holding health as a core value

what does that mean to hold health as a core value? Value: something you value.
[Ruth] 

does how we spend our time & money align with our values?



------ Dangers of comfort and convenience

[Ruth]
- human's are natually innovative so we have all this artificial comfort (cars, rich foods, sources of entertainment)
- that in and of itself is amazing but we've taken away a real need for the body to have natural tasks that make our bodies and brains feel good 
- like getting our food, (gardening, hunting)
- like physical movement and testing our bodies - 
- so we must be self aware in order to create opportunities to feel hungry for life. True hunger: physically, mentally (problem solving), emotionally
- goes back to Brad Johns' definition of health and go back to my own definition of health




==> lesson 1.2 Experiments:

- Define health for yourself. Audit your definition through the program and revise it at the end
- Ask 3 friends/family members how they define health
- What are 3 areas of your health that you want to increase your responsibility?
- Ask your partner how they define health, share the answers of your survey



------ Outro:

We hope you found this lesson helpful and took some notes in your log.

Listening to this is proof of work. 

Thank you for taking responsibility for your health and we hope you connect with your learning partner and podmates to discuss what we covered in this lesson.

Ciao for now friends
