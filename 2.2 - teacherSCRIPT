Framework:


- 



Experiments (nano to macro)

- Outline the experiment framework
- Design a 7 day experiment that requires 10 daily minutes of data collection
- Write down 5 experiments you want to do over the course of the program





------ Intro: [Ruth]

By now you've had some time with the material. You know us, Ruth & Nick. 

We welcome you to lesson 2.1 - First principles

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

Today's objective is to unpack the idea of first principles to provide a framework for laying down a solid foundation for realistically incorporating healthy practices into our lives.

If you have questions about the lesson, feel free to message us on Slack and if you want to contribute you can submit a pull request on github. 

Let's dig in.



------ Science: defined

A system for seeking truth




------ Science as a process





------- Applied science

[Nick] 

Fundamentally: trial and error done systematically

health is trial and error done systematically



------ becoming your own scientist

You are so complex, multivariate and unique, the only person capable of being your chief health scientist is you

Understand first principles, apply science and determine your truths. Share those truths and compare with others



------- Types of truth

Subjective truth: something you perceive to be true (earth is round or flat)

Objective truth: something that is true whether or not you believe it to be true (gravity)

The importance of truth: prevents manipulation

Ignorance is bliss



------ Designing productive experiments (hypothesis, methods, results, analysis)

What question are you looking to answer?

How can I create an experiment that gives me a high quality piece of data?

Does the data show a pattern?

Does the pattern answer my question?

How can I apply this knowledge?



------- More experiments, more data, more certainty




Experiments: 
- Explain the scientific method to someone
- design a 2 week health experiment and share it with your pod




------ Outro:

We hope you found this lesson helpful and took some notes in your log.

Listening to this is proof of work. 

Thank you for taking responsibility for your health and we hope you connect with your learning partner and podmates to discuss what we covered in this lesson.

Ciao for now friends
