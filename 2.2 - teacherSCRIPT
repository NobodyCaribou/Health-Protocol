------ Intro: [Ruth]

By now you've had some time with the material. You know us, Ruth & Nick. 

We welcome you to lesson 2.2

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

Today's lesson is covering the process of science - our consensus method for determining truth

If you have questions about the lesson or want to contribute resources or a layer 2 conversation, please message us on slack

Let's dig in.


------ Science: defined

A system for seeking truth

A way of thinking that prevents us from believing what isn't true and also from not believing what is true

The skill of asking good questions and using a systematic process to seeks answers to those questions

A set of methods and tools that allow you to turn data into information. Information into knowledge. Knowledge into wisdom

A mindset. A way of thinking about the world

Science literacy is the antidote to the weaponizstion of science as a tool for deception

Believing what others say as truth without verifying that truth can get you into trouble

Science is the tool that can all wield to gain access to truth


------ Science as a process, not a thing

People often mistake a research paper for science

Research: Systematic investigation of something

Research is the application of science but not all research is good science

Turns out most research isn't good science. The current process of funding research leads to a lot of bias

A research study conclusion isn't the truth, it's an element that can be used in the quest to determine truth

A single high quality study is a piece of the puzzle, not the whole thing



------- Applied science

Trial and error done systematically

Health is trial and error done systematically

Babies are great little scientists. I'm watching this right now with my young niece

Movement skill is acquired in young babies by trial and error



------ Becoming your own scientist

Humans are very hard to study because our experiences are so different and the body is a complex system of systems we don't even fully understand yet

You are so complex, multivariate and unique, the only person capable of being your chief health scientist is you

Understand first principles, apply science and determine your truths. Share those truths and compare with others

A good scientists recognizes their suceptibility to bias

Productive scepticism: question what you are unsure of, but recognize when valid evidence is presented to change their mind

If everyone acquires a basic understanding of science, we collectively become immune to manipulation

We allow ourselves to see through deception when science is used as a religion to enforce biased beliefs



------- Types of truth

Personal truth: something you perceive to be true (earth is round or flat)

Objective truth: something that is true whether or not you believe it to be true (gravity)

Truth is reality. Some people find truth to be too uncomfortable and therefore choose to create their own reality

The problem is when those people try to force others to live in their personal reality

Discovering truth is very hard in a world where misinforming people is profitable

Ignorance is bliss - holds very very true today

Science doesn't care about my opinion or my feelings



------ Designing productive experiments (hypothesis, methods, results, analysis)

What question are you looking to answer?

How can I create an experiment that gives me a high quality piece of data?

Does the data show a pattern?

Does the pattern answer my question?

How can I apply this knowledge?

Example: ankle mobility experiment

Observation: my ankle is stiff, specifically: my right ankle is missing 15 degrees of dorsiflexion compared to my left side
Hypothesis: If I expose my ankle to end range everyday for 5 minutes, after 14 days my dorsiflexion will improve
Experiment: spend 5 minutes moving in and out of end range
Result: After 14 days of daily effort, has my ankle DF improved?

Yes? conclusion: spending time at end range of a desired ROM improves my ROM
No? conclusion: other factors are influencing my ankle mobility. Create a new experiment to test a new hypothesis (hip mobility?, shoes?)

Baseline data: accurate DF measurement
Daily log: tracking daily 5min completion, relevant notes



------- More experiments, more data, more certainty

If experiments are done systematically and effectively, the more experiments we do, the more data we collect, the more certainty we can gain

Think in probabilities based on the data set you have experienced

intelligent experiment design and careful analysis of results are keystone elements. Very important

Limits of memory: solved with your health log

Accurate measurements: if you're not measuring, you're guessing



------- Understand science so you don't have to "trust" the science of others

Saying "trust the science" is fundamentally unscientific

Evaluate research deeply: methodology, results, conlusion, applicability

Beware of biases and selective data presentation from those seeking to influence you



Experiments: 
- Explain the scientific method to someone
- Design a 7 day experiment that requires 10 daily minutes of data collection
- Design a 30 day health experiment and share it with your pod (5min meditation daily?)
- Outline the experiment framework
- Write down 5 experiments you want to do over the course of the program


------ Outro:

We hope you found this lesson helpful and took some notes in your log.

Listening to this is proof of work. 

Thank you for taking responsibility for your health and we hope you connect with your learning partner and podmates to discuss what we covered in this lesson.

Ciao for now friends
