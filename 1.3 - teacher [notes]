------ Intro:

Hello to everyone listening and welcome to the Foot Nerd Program. 

I’m Nick [and I’m Ruth] and we're honored to welcome you to lesson 1.3 

thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

Today's objective is to unpack the word community so you can understand and harness the power of community as you progress through your health journey.  

If you have questions about the lesson, feel free to message us on Slack and if you want to contribute you can submit a pull request on github. 

Let's dig in.


------ Defining community for yourself (note it in your log)

What is your current definition of community?

Ruth's definition of community:
- microlevel: our community of 60-70 trillion cells that make our human body, community begins with you, the individual
- question: how do you interact with those cells for the good of the organism
- radiates to the other humans, pets, plants and other living organisms in our immediate environment 
- question: How do you/I interact with those beings for the good of the household community?
- radiates to the humans, etc that are closest to me: neighbors, grocers, post office, pub etc...
- same question
- and so on and so forth
- when considering a "healthy community", begin with the self, then the closest in your vicinity and working your way outward
- when considering the creation of a healthy community, care for nearest and smallest community organism first (ie. cells to city)


Nick's definition of community: A web of organisms interdependent on one another for life

Personal community assessment: Do I feel integrated with the whole. With my family, with my local community, with the broader tfc community, with the web of nature

Communities are fractal - highly complex patterns that repeat across different scales

A tree: individual leaves form clusters, connect into branches, connect to a trunk

Same pattern repeats in our lungs, individual alveoli form clusters, connect into bronchioles, then into bronchi

Sense of community: membership (feeling like I belong), contribution (mattering to the group, making a difference), maintaining meaningful connection 


------ Community nutrients

Nutrient: a substance that provides nourishment essential for the maintenance of life and for growth

Typically used within the context of food but appropriate for many pillars, including community

[Ruth] What makes a healthy thriving community?

[Ruth]- Community Nutrients
-from the understanding that a community nutrient is a "substance that provides nourishment essential for the community to live and thrive"
1. active and passive participation 
2. willingness to offering something of yourself
3. willingness to receive the offerings of others
4. understanding your importance in the big picture

Community mal-nourishment: missing nutrients results in dis-integration of the web. Isolation

integration: bringing elements together to form a whole

Epidemic of loneliness coming from a life of isolation (at all levels: biological, social, separation from nature)

Technology: A tool that can connect or isolate depending on how it is used. Not neutral

Being digitally wired is not the same as being connected. Junk food of community nutrients. Tricking our biology to feel satisfied while remaining mal-nourished

Self awareness and body/mind literacy: sensing when I'm lacking community nutrients, knowing how to restore my nutrition

------- Layers of community

Atomic -> cellular -> social -> local -> national -> global

body as a community of cells, families as communities of humans, earth as a community of life


------ Learning pods

POD: a small social unit connected to the whole

Whale pod: a social unit (family) that is self supportive, shares resources and aligns on a purpose

Why we created them: to faciliate an immediate sense of community within small clusters of new members beginning their foot nerd journey

Bidirectional: being energized by and giving energy to your pod


------ Learning partner

Suggested in debrief calls by previous nerds, a support and learning partnership between two individuals

Someone to share your experience with, to learn from, to keep you accountable

Setting an intention with your partner: clarity on the help you want to receive and the support you are able to offer

A check-in cadence: weekly or monthly checkin scheduled (zoom call, slack message)

Bidirectional relationship. Openness, honesty. A potential lifelong relationship


------ How we use Slack

Purpose: a social platform to engage with other nerds

Every Nerd must choose their level of engagement. Community element of this program is what you make of it

A shared office space in cyberspace all Nerds are welcome to use

Channels: individual spaces within the office, conference rooms for topics

General channel: common area

Pod channel: dedicated room for your pod

Private messages: if you want to connect with an individual/group privately


------ How we use Github

Purpose: A platform to collaboratively evolve our understanding of health

Each lesson has it's own living document that changes over time based on input from Nerds

Contribute to a lesson: record a layer 2 conversation with another nerd, contribute a resource to a lesson, contact lesson teacher with feedback


==> lesson 1.3 Experiments:

- Define community for yourself (write in log)
- Ask close friends/family how they define community
- reflection: How do I currently get my community nutrients?
- List your layers of community in a visual diagram
- Start a conversation with a stranger in your local community
- Organize a community health discussion

[Ruth]
- reflect on the idea that your own body cells are a community that you are the mayor/governor of. What kind of mayor/governer of your body cells are you? Would you like to be?
- reflect on your immediate surrounding and take stock/inventory of your immediate home community and its state of affairs
- reflect on your immediate neighborhood and take stock/inventory of your surroundings and how you participate (passively and actively)

------ Outro:

We hope you found this lesson helpful and took some notes in your log.

Listening to this is proof of work. 

Thank you for taking responsibility for your health and we hope you connect with your learning partner and podmates to discuss what we covered in this lesson.

Ciao for now friends
