Lesson notes: know thy time

Notes:
- Planning: instead of starting with tasks to be done, start with your time
- start with determining where your time actually goes: do a time audit
- trim away unproductive demands on our time
- The output limits of any plan or process is set by the scarcest resouce
- our supply of time is inelastic: no matter how much demand exists, the supply of our time will not go up
- Humans have an unreliable sense of time. We tend to grossly underrate or overrate how much time we spend on something
- To rely on our memory is to not be very accurate 
- We tend to think that the things we should be spending our time on are actually the things we spend our time on
- To manage our time effectively we must first know where our time actually goes
- Distraction is a constant pressure toward unproductive and wasteful time use
- Saying no to things: either an absolutely yes or a no. Tightening the filter
- The more important or difficult something is, the easier it will be to get distracted
- Recording time, managing time, consolidating small tasks into chunks of time
- Health log: a time record of our attention spent on our health
- Setting aside time for important tasks allows for focus. Time that is unhurried and relaxed
- Feedback: feeling rushed or hurried is an indicator that I scheduled too much or that I underestimated time needed for something

- Great decisions or creations in my life have always come from un-interrupted focused time spent on them
- Time in large, continuous uninterrupted chunks is needed for important decisions or tasks. Health is an important task
- Out time demands are typically ever increasing
- We must be better at prioritizing what is worth spending time on and manage our time effectively to reflect our priorities
- We must first record record time before we can know where it goes and before we can attempt to manage it
- Time logs must be recorded in real time and not later from memory (which we discussed is not very good)
- Once a quarter I rethink and rework my time allocations to align how I spend my time with what I want to accomplish/work on
- I invevitably drift away into wasting time on unimportant things and so it's important to recalibrate
- Elimintaing non productive time wasters. Elininate things that are a pure waste of time (what would happen if I didn't do this? - nothing? stop doing it)
- Learning to say "no" to things that contribute zero value to our work or ourselves gets easier with practice
- 25% of time time often ends up being spent on pointless, wasteful things. These are what I clean up quarterly
- Which things can be done by someone else, just as well if not better?
- To get the important things done, we must clear away the unimportant
- Personal cost of living and the need to earn income. Modify the cost of living and perhaps less time must be spent making money
- Pruning time wasters
- Lack of focus/clarity is a time waster. Knowing what is important reduces the decisions that must be made about what to do
- Schedule the important things during your most focused hours of the day that have the least likely chance of being interrupted
- Time is the scarcest resource. If it cannot be managed, nothing can be managed
- The analysis of our time with regular audits is a very empowering tool to stimulate productive action towards our objectives
