We hope you enjoy listening. We welcome any/all productive feedback and we hope that you will record & share your own health story 

-------

Framework:

Nick notes:
- Sharing your journey to discover health is how you teach others what is possible
- Lead by example, share your commitment (1 daily hour) and help them make the commitment as well
- More people recaliming health responsibility = a healthier world
- Empower others to begin their own journey to kickstart their health process



The power of story

A forgotten learning tool (along with play)

Authentically sharing 

Pointing people in the right direction instead of telling then what to do


-------

Elements of story

Setting, characters, message, conflict (internal or external), resolution, perspective

Theme: what is your story about. In our case the theme is health

Setting: Your life, who you are, your circumstance (a window into your unique world)

Plot: what happens

Health is a journey filled with tension, adventure, conflict, struggle

-------

Health is the pursuit of greatness

We are each the hero (or victim) of our own Health stories so the journey of Health lends itself well to the format of story

-------

What motivated/motivates you to work on your health?

What was the most significant moment in your health journey to date?

What has was your most memorable challenge and how did you overcome it

What has been your most memorable victory?

How did the Foot Nerd Experience play a role in your health story?
