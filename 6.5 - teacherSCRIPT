The power of story

A forgotten learning tool (along with play)

Authentically sharing 

Pointing people in the right direction instead of telling then what to do


-------

Elements of story

Setting, characters, message, conflict (internal or external), resolution, perspective

Theme: what is your story about. In our case the theme is health

Setting: Your life, who you are, your circumstance (a window into your unique world)

Plot: what happens

Health is a journey filled with tension, adventure, conflict, struggle

-------

Health is the pursuit of greatness

We are each the hero (or victim) of our own Health stories so the journey of Health lends itself well to the format of story
