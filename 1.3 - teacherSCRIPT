If you have questions about the lesson, feel free to message us on Slack and if you want to contribute you can submit a pull request on github. 

Let's dig in.


------ Defining community for yourself (note it in your log)

What is your current definition of community?

Ruth's definition of community:
- microlevel: our community of 60-70 trillion cells that make our human body, community begins with you, the individual
- Question: how do you interact with those cells for the good of the organism
- radiates to the other humans, pets, plants and other living organisms in our immediate environment 
- Question: How do you/I interact with those beings for the good of the household community?
- radiates to the humans, etc that are closest to me: neighbors, grocers, post office, pub etc...
- Same question
- and so on and so forth
- when considering a "healthy community", begin with the self, then the closest in your vicinity and working your way outward
- when considering the creation of a healthy community, care for nearest and smallest community organism first (ie. cells to city)


Nick's definition of community:


------ Loneliness: a lack of community

What are the consequences of lack of community
[Ruth]
- Question we must ask first before asking about the consequences of lack of community is what makes a healthy thriving community?

Community nutrients
Nickypop, maybe we put community nutrients before "consequences of lack of community"?
That way we can define the nutrients and the consequences will be obvious? Your thoughts?

[Ruth]- Community Nutrients
- honest curiosity
- consistency
- self reliance
- offerings
- receptivity
- understanding (your importance)
