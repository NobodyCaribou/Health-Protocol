Let's dig in.


------ Defining community for yourself (note it in your log)

What is your current definition of community?

Ruth's definition of community:
- microlevel: our community of 60-70 trillion cells that make our human body, community begins with you, the individual
- question: how do you interact with those cells for the good of the organism
- radiates to the other humans, pets, plants and other living organisms in our immediate environment 
- question: How do you/I interact with those beings for the good of the household community?
- radiates to the humans, etc that are closest to me: neighbors, grocers, post office, pub etc...
- same question
- and so on and so forth
- when considering a "healthy community", begin with the self, then the closest in your vicinity and working your way outward
- when considering the creation of a healthy community, care for nearest and smallest community organism first (ie. cells to city)


Nick's definition of community:
-

[Ruth]
- reflect on the idea that your own body cells are a community that you are the mayor/governor of. What kind of mayor/governer of your body cells are you? Would you like to be?
