Audio lesson notes:
- detailed notes and timestamps from the audio lesson


Experiments (nano to macro)

- Explain the tree of understanding to a family member, partner
- Apply the SAID principle to an area of your body you wish to improve

Movement Experiment 
- Dynamic Squat 
- Goal: Complete 50 full range bodyweight squats 
(unassisted, feet hip width apart, between parallel and 10 degrees of external rotation, heels on the floor, hands anywhere you want) within 120 seconds. 
- collect notes about your experiments in detail in your health log

Tips:
- Similar to the squat position tips, begin wit a baseline by trying this out and seeing how you do
- Write yourself a note with the date and some information about how the first trial went, how it felt, if you had any pain, where you felt was limiting you
- Never continue working through sharp pain
- Embrace the process of continual improvement
- Spend time on your feet, ankle and hips with accessory work
- Do a LOT of hinges to pattern in hip dominance
- Consistency is king with this one. 
- Experience the squat every morning and see how many you can get done everyday without pain
- A major obstacle with this is tight hips. Spend time on the floor, less time in chairs and progress will come. 

Accessory work that can help:
- 90/90 hip external rotation work
- Hinges
- Balance work
- Spending time in the position holding onto support or using a weight to counter balance you

Reach out to your podmates and discuss it.
