------ Intro:

Hello beautiful foot nerds

Welcome to lesson 1.6

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

Today's lesson is about unpacking what it means to intentionally design the journey ahead

If you have questions about the lesson or want to contribute resources or a layer 2 conversation, please message us on slack

Let's dig in.



------ A clear purpose

Why are you doing this? Write it down

What is the purpose that will motivate you when things get challenging?

The clearer the intention, the higher the likelihood of success

Regarding the program, how do you define success after 360 days?


------ Values

Get clear on the things you value

What matters to you and how do those things align with this journey you've comitted to?

Know that our values change over time but being clear on our current values is important


------ Planning

Create a calendar (progress checklist), schedule your health time blocks

Contingency planning: what happens if you have a setback? what happens if you lose focus? Who can you look to for support?

Plan B: Go for a 45 minute walk and write about what was going through your mind, feelings, emotions, stressors

Deals with yourself: I don't watch netflix until i've worked on my health for an hour

Being flexible with your plan and updating it regularly



------ Prompts

Design reminders

Phone prompts, object/environment prompts


------ Setting boundaries

When is your health hour?

Tell other people about it, why it's important to you and why you aren't available during that time

Parent: discuss a plan with your kids/partner to let them know when/why you're working on your health


------ Defining traction

Traction: forward motion towards your objective

Dis-traction: slipping away from your objective

Clearly define traction so it's easy to spot distraction

Traction: Show up intentionally for 1 hour per day for 360 days

Enables detection of distraction (scrolling IG instead of doing your hour that day = distraction)

How many times a week do you log into slack to check in with the community?

Connect with your partner every 2 weeks for a 30min call?
