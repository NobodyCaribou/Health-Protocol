------ Intro:

Hello to everyone listening and welcome to the Foot Nerd Program. 

I’m Nick [and I’m Ruth] and we're honored to welcome you to lesson 1.2 

thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

in order to improve our health we first need to define health and develop a shared definition of what health. That's the objective for lesson 1.2

If you have questions about the lesson, feel free to message us on Slack and if you want to contribute you can submit a pull request on github. 

Let's dig in.


------ Defining health for yourself

Health is subjective. Everyone will have their own definition and thats a good thing. As an experiment, pause this right now and write down your
definition of health in your log. It's a really insightful exercise and gives you a reference point to check back on as you continue learning. 

In my experience I've found my definition to be very dynamic and flexible. A definition that shifts over time as my understanding expands

[Ruth's definition of health]
In my definition, the word health is synonymous with "a high quality of life" and that is defined by:
- having a clear understanding that my body is designed on a fundamental physiological level to seek ease, comfort and balance  at all times 
- my body is designed to feel good
- with this clarity, I also understand that this body, being my one only true asset, will happily do what I ask it to if I give it:
- the love of deep nourishing and delicious sleep/rest/meditatation
- if I feed it food, not too much, mostly plants 
- if I am playfully enjoying regular and also useful movement (think gardening and carrying groceries) all through the day 
- and if I am connected to other humans who are pursuing the same.


Nick's definition of health: the process of learning how to take better care of myself and prioritizing energy towards making small daily changes.

To me, health is:
- proof of work
- a process of explation
- my most important job
- a birthright
- an inside job (nobody can make you healthy except yourself)
- what makes time valuable


------ Mighty community definitions

Every member who joins our mighty network answers a few questions in order to join. One of those questions is: "how do you define health in a single sentence"?

We ask this to everyone with the aim to learn how others define health and also to provide us with data that we can use to tease out common threads/principles

Ruth and I have each picked our favourite 3 submissions from Mighty community members:

[Ruths 3]
- A high quality of life made as simple as possible [Chase Tucker]
- The ability to recover and adapt well to stress [Brad Johns]
- The ability to feel and identify how I am at any point. In other words, "know thy self" [Beth Peltier]
- I asked my spouse and he said this: "A peace that surpasses all understanding" - [Matthew Gervase]

(NickyPop, I didn't read yours before I chose mine and we picked 2 of the same ones! :)

Nick's 3:
- Having the ability to be physically and mentally ready for any and all life events [Alex Cumblad]
- The ability to recover from and adapt well to stress [Brad Johns]
- Our natural state [Evan Maxwell]
- The ability to sense, feel and identify how I am at any point, in other words, "know thy self" [Beth Peltier]

Common threads: absence of disease, mental, physical and spiritual components, balance, the ability to do what we want. 

------- Health as process, not a destination

Common misperception: health is a look or a destination. Once you get there you're done

reality: health is a process, not a destination

many paths to take, none are right/wrong

a process of continual mindful exploration

balance of exploation and (informational) exploitation


------ Continuum of responsibility

It’s easy to get constantly distracted and forfeit responsibility

It’s work to remain focused and claim full responsibility

Assumption: my body works perfectly until I cause it problems. Therefore, if someone is wrong, I ask what I'M doing to cause it before seeking external reasons

Moving along the continuum from zero to full responsibility. A mindset


------ A lifelong process

FNP as a kickstart to begin the journey so you have tools for a lifetime



------ Holding health as a core value

what does that mean?

does how we spend our time align with health?



------ Dangers of comfort and convenience



==> lesson 1.2 Experiments:

- Define health for yourself. Audit your definition through the program and revise it at the end
- Ask 3 friends/family members how they define health
- What are 3 areas of your health that you want to increase your responsibility?
- Ask your partner how they define health, share the answers of your survey



------ Outro:

We hope you found this lesson helpful and took some notes in your log.

Listening to this is proof of work. 

Thank you for taking responsibility for your health and we hope you connect with your podmates about this lesson.

Ciao for now friends
