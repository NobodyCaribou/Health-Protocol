------ Intro:

Hello to everyone listening and welcome to the Foot Nerd Program. 

I’m Nick [and I’m Ruth] and we're honored to welcome you to lesson 1.2 

thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

in order to improve our health we first need to define health and develop a shared definition of what health. That's the objective for lesson 1.2

We are on Slack at least once a week. If you have questions about the lesson, feel free to message us. Want to contribute? submit a pull request on github. 

Let's dig in.


------ Defining health for yourself

an important exercise (write it in your log)

a dynamic definition that shifts over time as your understanding expands

Ruth's definition of health

Nick's definition of health (health is proof of work, health is a process of exploration, health is our most important job, health is our birthright, health 
makes time valuable)


------ Mighty community definitions

why we ask members their definition

finding common threads/principles

Ruth's top 3
Nick's top 3


------- Health as process, not a destination

many paths to take, none are right/wrong

a process of continual mindful exploration


------ Continuum of responsibility





------ A lifelong process

FNP as a kickstart to begin the journey




------ Holding health as a core value

what does that mean?

does how we spend our time align with health?



------ Dangers of comfort and convenience




==> lesson 1.2 Experiments:

- Ask 3 friends/family members how they define health
- What are 3 areas of your health that you want to increase your responsibility?
- Ask your partner how they define health, share the answers of your survey



------ Outro:
