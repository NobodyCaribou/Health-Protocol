------ Intro:

Hello to everyone listening and welcome to lesson 1.4 of the foot nerd program

I’m Nick [and I’m Ruth] and in this lesson we're sharing our understanding of meta learning

thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

Today's objective is to unpack the concept of meta learning in hopes that it helps you unlock your highest learning potential  

If you have questions about the lesson or want to contribute, feel free to message us on Slack

Let's dig in


------ Learning to understand, not to know

To me, understanding is dynamic while knowing is rigid

Knowing is shallow, understanding is deep

Knowing is easy and can be done through memorization (little brain energy)

Understanding is difficult and can only be done with exploration & synthesis (muchos brain energy)

Knowing can be theoretical, understanding must be experiential

to understand:
- comprehension, insight based on the learner having experience
- the knowledge and ability to judge a particular situation or subject
- the power of comprehending
- the power to make experience intelligible by applying concepts or categories

to know:
- to have information of some kind in mind
- to have a complete idea of something


[Ruth] understanding is more important than knowledge because
- in the Think, Do, Be model - knowledge is 1st step and also trivial if it stays there (trivial = meaningless)
- understanding is what happens when knowledge is applied, rehearsed, committed to memory, experimented with and integrated 
- understanding, as a result is what makes being human fun, rich and allows for appreciation on a sensorial level as well.
-Think, Do, Be
- Phiolospher, Initiate, Master
- Knowledge, Experience, Wisdom
- Learning with Head, then hands, and then we know by heart

[Ruth]
- in the definition "to know" something lacks the personal insight and depth that comes with personal experience of the thing.
- understanding something acknowledges the transition from trivial knowledge to personal experience
- to know a concept (1st step), to experience the concept personally, experientially (2nd step) imprints or entrains experience and then the learner "understands"
- it is more important to understand because the learned thing is now imprinted and it is a part of the learner's long term memory, it is 
- in other languages, there are different definitions of "to know" to express depth of understanding 
- example: French has savoir and conaitre - to savoir is to know something mentally only while to conaitre is to know something/someone deeply with personal experience

Understanding: being able explain something in different ways depending on the person youre speaking with


[Ruth]
- if we can explain the model, then we're ready to experience it
- once we experience it, then we're primed and ready for transformation

[Ruth] Extra Notes:
- explaining something in different ways to different people requires deep understanding of the subject you are speaking on
- requires creativity and imagination
- we gain this creative, imaginative and deep understanding by making the attempts to explain, 
- to recognize the discomfort of failed attempts (inaccuracies, etc)
- reflect by asking where it went wonky, correct it, try again to explain it
- explaining same concept to people who understand deeply or don't understand at all
- explaining visually, auditorally, writing etc are expansive tools to understanding deeply what you're learning
- oftentimes, we try to work alone at the understanding because we don't want to feel foolish or appear not to understand 
- it is only in the repetitious attempts, reflections on where the understanding is strong or weak and to try again, refining and nuancing as we go along

traditional education: based on memorizing/knowing


[Ruth]
- from "meta learning" definition - "the state of being aware of and taking control of one's own learning"
- traditional learning isn't an effective or efficient model, relying heavily on the sender/receiver model 
- the sender/teacher "teaches" - disperses the knowledge lecture, video, slides, etc.
- the learner is passively receiving (at best. in my experience)
- in teaching anatomy, the poor model of teaching/learning traditionally is evident 
- in my experience, as an instructor, we were hired into a department with a curriculum in place with a unified syllabus and we followed that habit of teaching 
- from my perspective, the model of teaching/learning still exists and is extraordinarily outdated and has not been changed, maybe since the beginning of time :) 
- in this model, the learner is entrusted to assign meaning outside of the "teaching session" but without knowing how to learn, the course was inevitably dry and lifeless
- sad and ironic since we were spending 15 weeks discussing what should be the most interesting subject in the world to a human with a human body!
- the learners access the syllabus and in a state of panic (decreases ability to learn/deeply with open focus)begin the attempt to commit the structures and functions
- "for the test"
- the language of the learners was predictable in this traditional style of class - "just memorize for the test"
notes:
- definition of "traditional" = habitually done 
- in order for traditional model to effective, teaching/learning habits require monitoring, evaluating and updating



Understanfing is done within a systems context. Knowing can be done in an isolated context. 

Learn something you are authentically curious about

our individual learning capacity combines into our collective learning capacity and ability to create a high level of collective intelligence


------ What is meta learning?

Learn defined:
- to gain knowledge or skill by studying, practicing, being taught or experiencing something
- to cause something to be in your memory by studying it (memorize)


Meta learning defined: learning to learn. Exploring and observing my different ways of learning and optimizing learning effiency by understanding myself

- early definition: the process by which learners become aware of and increasingly in control of habits of their learning, perception, inquiry, and growth 
- the learner has internalized the process of learning
-has 5 principles:
1. the learner has a theory
2. the learner must have access to a safe, supportive, social, physical environment
3. must discover their rules and assumptions
4. must be able to reconnect with reality-information from environment
5. must recognize themselves by changin their rules and assumptions

[Ruth] - essentially the learner must be able to take a piece of knowledge and spend time with it, experiment with it and integrate it?

- more recent definition: "the state of being aware of and taking control of one's own learning"




------ Learning as a skill

skill defined:
- the ability to do something well; expertise
- the ability to do something that comes from training, experience or practice
- the ability to use one's knowledge effectively and readily in execution or performance

anyone can acquire and practice the skill of learning

everyone will learn differently but there are some common elements 



------- Learning as a practice

practice defined:
- to do something again and again in order to become better at it
- the actual application or use of an idea, belief, or method, as opposed to theories relating to it
- repeated exercise in or performance of an activity or skill so as to acquire or maintain proficiency in it.


------ Learning as a mindset

mindset defined:
- a mental attitude or inclination

growth mindset vs fixed mindset (carol dweck book)


------ Expanding learning capacity

learning capacity defined: the amount of information that can be consumed and integrated within a specified period of time

focus: the concentration of effort and attenmtion on a single topic/activity

focus defined:
-a subject that is being discussed or studied
-a main purpose or interest

focus unit defined: what is the period of time that you can maintain full and deep focus on something for. 

baseline focus unit measurement: how long can you read something for without your mind wandering or getting distracted? 

self awareness required to honestly evaluate focus level


------ Focus training

Tools: meditation, beam training (my training wheels for meditation)

Practicing deep learning regularly


------ Deep learning

Undistrated, intentional learning. Done in a space optimized for how you learn best

Create rituals and routines that trigger a state of deep focus (beam, earmuffs, mantra)


------ Design a learning environment

why? because the enviroment nudges our behaviours more than we think

features: minimal, reduce clutter, defend from distractions (no phone or external triggers visible)

adjust dynamically as needed


------ Scheduling learning time

determine optimal learning time of day (exploration initially)

time you have full control over

prompts (the day before, phone alerts)

tracking: are you making productive use of the time, dynamically adjust



==> lesson 1.4 Experiments:


- Reflection: How do I learn best? (medium, environment, topic, time of day)
- Refelction: What is my current capacity for focused learning?
- Beam play: 10 minutes of focused balance work
- What do I WANT to learn about?
- Connect with your learning partner to share insights about how you learn best
- What are my obstacles to learning?



------ Outro:

We hope you found this lesson helpful and took some notes in your log.

Listening to this is proof of work. 

Thank you for taking responsibility for your health and we hope you connect with your learning partner and podmates to discuss what we covered in this lesson.

Ciao for now friends
