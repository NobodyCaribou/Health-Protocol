------ Intro:

Hello to everyone listening and welcome to lesson 1.4 of the foot nerd program

I’m Nick [and I’m Ruth] and in this lesson we're sharing our understanding of meta learning

thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

Today's objective is to unpack the concept of meta learning in hopes that it helps you unlock your highest learning potential  

If you have questions about the lesson, feel free to message us on Slack and if you want to contribute you can submit a pull request on github

Let's dig in


------ Learning to understand, not to know

to understand:
- comprehension, insight based on the learner having experience
- the knowledge and ability to judge a particular situation or subject
- the power of comprehending
- the power to make experience intelligible by applying concepts or categories
Note from Ruth to Nick: I added these definitions for us. It seems like we're both looking at many of the same ones so I thought I'd type these in. 

to know:
- to have information of some kind in mind
- to have a complete idea of something

why understanding is much more important than knowing




[Ruth]
- in the definition "to know" something lacks the personal insight and depth that comes with personal experience of the thing.
- understanding something acknowledges the transition from trivial knowledge to personal experience
- to know a concept (1st step), to experience the concept personally, experientially (2nd step) imprints or entrains experience and then the learner "understands"
- it is more important to understand because the learned thing is now imprinted and it is a part of the learner's long term memory, it is 
- in other languages, there are different definitions of "to know" to express depth of understanding 
- example: French has savoir and conaitre - to savoir is to know something mentally only while to conaitre is to know something/someone deeply with personal experience

explain something in different ways depending on the person youre speaking with


[Ruth]
- explaining something in different ways to different people requires deep understanding of the subject you are speaking on
- requires creativity and imagination
- we gain this creative, imaginative and deep understanding by making the attempts to explain, 
- to recognize the discomfort of failed attempts 
- reflect by asking where it went wonky, correct it, try again to explain it
- oftentimes, we try to work alone at the understanding because we don't want to feel foolish or appear not to understand 
- it is only in the repetitious attempts, reflections on where the understanding is strong or weak and to try again, refining and nuancing as we go along

traditional education: based on memorizing/knowing


[Ruth]
- traditional learning isn't an effective or efficient model, in my experience.
- relying on sender/receiver model 
- the sender/teacher "teaches" - disperses the knowledge lecture, video, slides, etc.
- the learner is passively receiving (at best)
- in teaching anatomy, the traditional method of teaching and learning is evident 
- in my experience, as an instructor, we were hired into a department with a curriculum in place and a unified syllabus and we followed that habit of teaching 
- from my perspective, the model of teaching/learning still exists and is extraordinarily outdated and has not been changed, maybe since the beginning of time :) 
- in this model, the learner is entrusted to assign meaning outside of the "teaching session" but without knowing how to learn, the course was inevitably dry and lifeless
- sad and ironic since we were spending 15 weeks discussing what should be the most interesting subject in the world to a human with a human body!
- the learners access the syllabus and in a state of panic (decreases ability to learn/deeply with open focus)begin the attempt to commit the structures and functions
- "for the test"
- the language of the learners was predictable in this traditional style of class - "just memorize for the test"
- definition of "traditional" = habitually done (habits require monitoring, evaluating and updating)




systems context

Learn something you are authentically curious about

our individual learning capacity combines into our collective learning capacity and ability to create a high level of collective intelligence


------ What is meta learning?

Learn defined:
- to gain knowledge or skill by studying, practicing, being taught or experiencing something
- to cause something to be in your memory by studying it (memorize)


Meta learning defined:
- early definition: the process by which learners become aware of and increasingly in control of habits of their learning, perception, inquiry, and growth 
- the learner has internalized the process of learning
-has 5 principles:
1. the learner has a theory
2. the learner must have access to a safe, supportive, social, physical environment
3. must discover their rules and assumptions
4. must be able to reconnect with reality-information from environment
5. must recognize themselves by changin their rules and assumptions

[Ruth] - essentially the learner must be able to take a piece of knowledge and spend time with it, experimentwith it and integrate it?

- more recent definition: "the state of being aware of and taking control of one's own learning"




------ Learning as a skill

skill defined:
- the ability to do something well; expertise
- the ability to do something that comes from training, experience or practice
- the ability to use one's knowledge effectively and readily in execution or performance

anyone can acquire and practice the skill of learning

everyone will learn differently but there are some common elements 



------- Learning as a practice

practice defined:



------ Learning as a mindset

mindset defined:

growth mindset vs fixed mindset (carol dweck book)


------ Expanding learning capacity

learning capacity defined:

focus defined:

focus unit defined:

baseline focus unit measurement

self awareness required to honestly evaluate focus level


------ Focus training

Tools: meditation, beam training (my training wheels for meditation)

Practicing deep learning regularly


------ Deep learning

Pure focus


------ Design a learning environment

why?

features

adjust as needed


------ Scheduling learning time

prompts

tracking



==> lesson 1.4 Experiments:


- Reflection: How do I learn best? (medium,environment, topic)
- Refelction: What is my current capacity for focused learning?
- Beam play: 10 minutes of focused balance work
- What do I WANT to learn about?
- Connect with your learning partner to share insights about how you learn best
- What are my obstacles to learning?



------ Outro:

We hope you found this lesson helpful and took some notes in your log.

Listening to this is proof of work. 

Thank you for taking responsibility for your health and we hope you connect with your learning partner and podmates to discuss what we covered in this lesson.

Ciao for now friends
