Signs of not enough sleep 
- physical fatigue / increased resting heart rate and lack of energy
- need to start your day with caffeine
- inhibits learning and memory, especially short term memory
- poor decision making through emotional and reactive centers of the brain being main drivers 
- worsened problem solving capabilities  - logic and reasoning centers shut down
- less efficient in performing tasks
- less ability to act rationally and avoid violent behaviour 
- reproductive health diminishes; less attractive (Swedish study)
- repeatedly contracting infections, or difficulty recovering from infections (poor immune system functioning)
- shift work in some countries classified as carcinogenic

Circadian Rhythm and Sleep 
-Etymology and definition
-Location, timing, daily resetting
-Internal and external clocks
-Synchronization
-Light and melatonin 
-Response to light
-Asynchrony
-Light exposure: then and now
-Optimizing patterns
-Eating, exercise and your clock
-Practical timing

EXPERIMENTS - TRACKING:
Evaluate your sleep - do you have trouble sleeping? how much do you sleep? how do you feel when you wake up? what is preventing you from sleeping optimally? Log in your journal (or with sleep tracking device)

Sleep Hygiene 
- regularity (bedtime alarm + sleep opportunity)
- curfews: caffeine + alcohol + screens
- light (natural, artificial, apps, glasses, bulbs) 
- cool, dark, quiet (curtains, plants/air quality/window)
- mattress, pillow
- food
- relaxing bedtime routine
- expend energy during day
- pets 
- EMFs

Experiments: improving your sleep - 1 experiment / pillar - select from examples or choose your own - implement for two weeks (or preferrably six weeks for setting new habits)
SLEEP: earlier bedtime, regularity, natural wake time (sleep debt)
FOOD: caffeine, alcohol, timing, composition of meals
MOVEMENT: timing, intensity or type, adequacy, outdoors
MIND: meditation / yoga nidra, gratitude, screen stimulation, prioritising sleep, 
COMMUNITY: bonding before bed (alone or with another), loneliness (anxiety), purpose/volunteerism, nature

Re-evaluate / track sleep after the experiment period. Do you notice any difference in your everyday life? Note these, and document.
Target: to feel rested and energized in the morning and not having to use stimulants (caffeine etc) to wake up/staying alert.
