------ Intro: 

Hello beaitiful nerds and welcome to lesson 5.1 where we will be covering the topic of Self awareness

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

Today's objective is to unpack the concept of self awareness and how it relates to health

If you have questions about the lesson, feel free to message us on Slack and if you want to contribute you can submit a pull request on github. 

Let's dig in.



Notes:
- Cultivating self awareness by spending time in solitude (free of input from other minds) with my own thoughts
- Being curious about my triggers, addictions and blind spots
- Discovering my blind spots through others. Being around people who lovingly help each other discover blind spots
- At least 1 hour per day with my own thoughts. Full focus on the present experience. No distractions
- Own my outbursts and learn to master my ego. Recognize it and keep it within my awareness

- Self awareness is developed through time alone and close relationships
- Questions: what upsets me? Who upsets me? What makes me happy? What are my blind spots? what are my triggers? my biases? my vulnerabilities?
- The things we take personally and upset us the most often have a lot of truth to them. They are often unresolved elements
- Self examination practices (time alone, debriefs after difficult situations)
- Being myself requires that I know myself
- Acting like someone you aren't all the time is exhausting
- Time spent undistracted and alone, in self examination, journaling, meditation - brings us from foggy to clear about who we are and from mentally fat to fit

Esther's podcast notes
- "Complimentarities" = otherness - I love how she spoke about and reframed to embrace the differences between as asset to relationship not a threat
- otherness typically is a trigger
- we go from seeing the trigger or the difference as an advantage
- Foot Nerds embrace differences - understanding that we are so much stronger and life is way more rich and interesting with the differences


------ Self awareness: defined

Before we start: pause this and answer two questions in your log: How do you define self awareness? What do you do to foster it?

[Ruth] Notes for overall lesson:
-What is Self Awareness? - being familiar with/knowing our own internal states, resources, intuitions
-What does it have to do with our health? A significant part of the quality of our lives is determined by our personal outlook on life. 
- Why is it important? Self awareness -> self acceptance/compassion -> trickles into the world around us --> we have compassion for the world around us which naturally
  enhances the quality of life in the external world
- Before there is Self Awareness, there is Autopilot. 
- Benefits of autopilot: 
  autopilot is great so that we don't have to think, feel about making our hot beverages, tying our shoelaces, starting the ignition of the car etc.
- When is it that autopilot isn't enough?
- When in life does it become necessary to explore our own levels of self awareness?
- When there are repetitive obstacles that interfere in our important relationships, life goals, feeling okay living in our flesh homes,  etc
- When the same stories (anguish) show up even though people or places change

- Personally, when mentors, elders, or teachers said the thing I never really paid attention to:
 "The way you feel about the world and the people around you are a good reflection of your internal life"  
 
- Meditation: A tool to become familiar with what's happening on the inside - a form of self reflection without words 

- Nick's experiment - on asking someone you love to tell you something about yourself they don't like: why did it frighten me so?
- Trust: our upbringing has an effect on our triggers and reaction patterns. When I was growing up, everyone in my family regularly and enthusiastically 
told each other what they didn't like about one another.
- A moment of self awareness training during the preparation for the the self awareness lesson
- The way I've scaffolded tools for self awareness is less through conversation and more through physical and creative experiments due to those triggers from my own upbringing
- Lots of self awareness training and exploration of my insides when I was younger also led to distraction by staying at that level
- Self reflection became Navel gazing or self obsession (when self awareness becomes a hindrance to progress)
- Tennis and other sports - How I react when I win, lose, or any number of unpredictable occurences. A literal safety net is there between the "players"
- Musical instruments - How do I respond as a begginner, the frustrations, the victories etc., the building blocks of creating a beautiful sound
- Beam play

- Using the tools of awareness from sports, creativity and then experimenting in relationships with awareness 

- Summary: Autopilot, Something's Off, there must be more - what am I doing wrong?
  Explorations in self awareness - what's happening inside me, yo? Lots to look at: Caution: We can get caught here - constant exploration in
  feeling can also be a distraction from risk in real time in real relationships and other experiences. 
  Moving on to use the tools of self awareness to grow and enjoy life


[Nick]
- Awareness: state of being conscious of something
- Self: me as an individual

Introspection: the examination or observation of my own mental and emotional processes

How well do I understand myself?

Self awareness is the result of self examination. The more self examination, the more self aware we become (in theory)

Self examination: Observing myself (my actions, my thoughts, my feelings, emotions) nonjudgementally and learning through curiosity

Actively looking to discover my blind spots. 


------ Taking responsibility starts with awareness

The ability to respond productively to a situation requires an awareness of what is happening




------- Self examination: practices

Time in solitude, through relationship with others, journaling, meditation


------ Non judgemental curiosity

Example: I blew up at someone. Taking time to inquire: why, what upset me, why did I react like that? no shame or guilt, just curiosity

Why did I just spend an hour scrolling instagram? Why did I eat that bag of candy? 


------- Welcoming and seeking honest feedback from others

Accepting criticism without trying to defend myself



------- Learning from triggers


------- Self regulation

What are my limits?



Experiments:
- How do you define self awareness? What are your practices to foster it?
- What is one thing you do that you want to stop? Why do you do it?
- Write down a note every time you get triggered by something
- What 3 people in your life can you trust to give you honest feedback?
