Intro: how do you define self awareness? What do you do to foster it?


Framework:

- Defining awareness & self awareness
- Responsibility requires awareness
- The practice of self examination
- Non judgemental curiosity
- Welcoming and seeking honest feedback from others
- Learning from triggers
- Self regulation 

Notes:
- I don't know what I don't know
- Cultivating self awareness by spending time in solitude (free of input from other minds) with my own thoughts
- Being curious about my triggers, addictions and blind spots
- Discovering my blind spots through others. Being around people who lovingly help each other discover blind spots
- At least 1 hour per day with my own thoughts. Full focus on the present experience. No distractions
- Own my outbursts and learn to master my ego. Recognize it and keep it within my awareness

- Self awareness is the result of self examination
- The value of observing myself non judgementally and taking notes
- Self awareness is developed through time alone and close relationships
- Questions: what upsets me? Who upsets me? What makes me happy? What are my blind spots? what are my triggers? my biases? my vulnerabilities?
- The things we take personally and upset us the most often have a lot of truth to them. They are often unresolved elements
- Self examination practices (time alone, debriefs after difficult situations)
- Being myself requires that I know myself
- Acting like someone you aren't all the time is exhausting
- Time spent undistracted and lone, in self examination, journaling, meditation - brings us from foggy to clear about who we are and from mentally fat to fit


Experiments (nano to macro)

- What is one thing you do that you want to stop? Why do you do it?
- Write down a note every time you get triggered by something
- What 3 people in your life can you trust to give you honest feedback?
- Ask someone you love to honestly tell you one thing they don't like about you
