------ Intro: 

Hello beaitiful nerds and welcome to lesson 5.1 where we will be covering the topic of Self awareness

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

If you have questions about the lesson, feel free to message us on Slack and if you want to contribute you can submit a pull request on github. 

Let's dig in.



Notes:
- Cultivating self awareness by spending time in solitude (free of input from other minds) with my own thoughts
- Being curious about my triggers, addictions and blind spots
- Discovering my blind spots through others. Being around people who lovingly help each other discover blind spots
- At least 1 hour per day with my own thoughts. Full focus on the present experience. No distractions
- Own my outbursts and learn to master my ego. Recognize it and keep it within my awareness

- Self awareness is developed through time alone and close relationships
- Questions: what upsets me? Who upsets me? What makes me happy? What are my blind spots? what are my triggers? my biases? my vulnerabilities?
- The things we take personally and upset us the most often have a lot of truth to them. They are often unresolved elements
- Self examination practices (time alone, debriefs after difficult situations)
- Being myself requires that I know myself
- Acting like someone you aren't all the time is exhausting
- Time spent undistracted and alone, in self examination, journaling, meditation - brings us from foggy to clear about who we are and from mentally fat to fit

------ Self awareness: defined

Before we start: pause this and answer two questions in your log: How do you define self awareness? What do you do to foster it?

[Ruth]
- When in life does it become necessary to explore our own levels of self awareness?
- When relationships became difficult to navigate - when same stories show up even though people or places change
- When mentors, elders, or teachers said the thing I never really paid attention to:
- The way you feel about the world and the people around you are a good reflection of your internal life 

[Nick]
- Awareness: state of being conscious of something
- Self: me as an individual

Introspection: the examination or observation of my own mental and emotional processes

How well do I undestand myself?

Self awareness is the result of self examination. The more self examination, the more self aware we become (in theory)

Self examination: Observing myself (my actions, my thoughts, my feelings, emotions) nonjudgementally and learning through curiosity

Actively looking to discover my blind spots. 


------ Taking responsibility starts with awareness

The ability to respond productively to a situation requires an awareness of what is happening




------- Self examination: practices

Time in solitude, through relationship with others, journaling, meditation


------ Non judgemental curiosity

Example: I blew up at someone. Taking time to inquire: why, what upset me, why did I react like that? no shame or guilt, just curiosity

Why did I just spend an hour scrolling instagram? Why did I eat that bag of candy? 


------- Welcoming and seeking honest feedback from others

Accepting criticism without trying to defend myself



------- Learning from triggers


------- Self regulation

What are my limits?



Experiments:
- How do you define self awareness? What are your practices to foster it?
- What is one thing you do that you want to stop? Why do you do it?
- Write down a note every time you get triggered by something
- What 3 people in your life can you trust to give you honest feedback?
