------ Intro: [speaker]

Hello beautiful humans

Welcome to lesson 3.1

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

Today's lesson is titled "know thy time" and was largely inspired by a chapter in "the effective executive" by Peter Drucker

If you have questions about the lesson or want to contribute resources or a layer 2 conversation, please message us on slack

Let's dig in.



Notes:
- Planning: instead of starting with tasks to be done, start with your time
- start with determining where your time actually goes: do a time audit
- trim away unproductive demands on our time
- The output limits of any plan or process is set by the scarcest resouce
- our supply of time is inelastic: no matter how much demand exists, the supply of our time will not go up
- Humans have an unreliable sense of time. We tend to grossly underrate or overrate how much time we spend on something
- To rely on our memory is to not be very accurate 
- We tend to think that the things we should be spending our time on are actually the things we spend our time on
- To manage our time effectively we must first know where our time actually goes
- Distraction is a constant pressure toward unproductive and wasteful time use
- Saying no to things: either an absolutely yes or a no. Tightening the filter
- The more important or difficult something is, the easier it will be to get distracted
- Recording time, managing time, consolidating small tasks into chunks of time
- Health log: a time record of our attention spent on our health
- Setting aside time for important tasks allows for focus. Time that is unhurried and relaxed
- Feedback: feeling rushed or hurried is an indicator that I scheduled too much or that I underestimated time needed for something
