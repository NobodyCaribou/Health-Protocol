Hi Malin, :) Nick created a scaffold with topics to cover and I just took some notes down. It's just a draft and I'll look forward to building this lesson 
you so I'll be looking forward to reading your notes. You can rearrange and insert wherever you'd like. I'm super flexible with the flow of all this.
Love, Ruth

------ Intro: [Ruth or Malin]

Hello beautiful humans

Welcome to lesson 3.1

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

Today's lesson is titled "know thy time" and was largely inspired by a chapter in "the effective executive" by Peter Drucker

If you have questions about the lesson or want to contribute resources or a layer 2 conversation, please message us on slack

Let's dig in.

[Ruth Notes]
What does time have to do with health?
We often neglect tending to our health in favor everything else we do in life. Making time to change our habits for the better gets put off. 
Time is filled in our modern world easily and we are not encouraged to inventory our time or to ask ourselves if the way we use our 
time is serving us. We mostly plough through and hope for the best.

- a tiny bit of background about Peter Drucker and "The Effective Executive"
- it was written in 1967 and is still relevant, maybe even moreso now.
- an executive is anyone administrative or managerial responsibility
- so each of us has the managerial responsibility for caring our health and that makes each of us an executive
- definition of effective - : producing a result that is wanted : having an intended effect


------ Time as our only scarce resource
- in Drucker's book, he describes how we can get some of almost everything we've lost back (health, money, etc) but it's not so with time. 
- time is the thing in life that once it's gone, we don't get it back
- so the question becomes, How would you most like to be using your time, since we don't get that back? Reflect on how you want to be using your time. Make a list.


------ Shortcomings of our memory
- it turns out when we're asked to break down our time and report what we did with it, our memory doesn't work very well. 
- in studies where people asked to recall compared with what actually happened, they got it wrong.
- so if we'd like to use our time for things we value, we have to first identify what we value and what we'd like to be doing with our time
- then we need to track what we are actually doing with the time we have

------ Time audit
- the time audit is the record of how we use our time
- it is the most important step in the process of becoming the effective executive our time and ultimately our health
- for a certain period of time, you track and record in real time what you do with all the hours in your day- honestly
- example: I have  a book - one page is "the plan" and the next page "what actually happened"

------ Alignment check
- once we have the time record of exactly how our time is used
- we compare that with how we want to be using our time and also our values 
- the alignment check is when we look at the data in our time record and see how much of the time is spent in or out of alignment with what's important to us.
- examples: 



------ System: time block calendar

Observation: structure is freedom



------ Schedule what matters

Words




------- Experiments: 

- How much time do you think you spend on social media per week? Track and verify for 7 days
- Write down the top 3 things worth your time
- What are your most productive times of the day?
- Create a time block calendar for a week
- Do a 7-day time audit (record each day for a week)


------ Outro:
