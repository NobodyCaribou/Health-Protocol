------ Intro: [speaker]

Hello beautiful foot nerds

Welcome to lesson 3.1

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

Today's lesson is covering financial literacy and the effect that money has on our health

If you have questions about the lesson or want to contribute resources or a layer 2 conversation, please message us on slack

Let's dig in.


Context:

I've had two parallel interests in my life for the past 5 years: health and bitcoin

At the start of this year those two interests converged when I came to the realization that our current fiat money system is a massive obstacle to health


Important point: Bitcoin must not be conflated with crypto. They are fundamentally different things

Bitcoin is an open, decentralized, global network that supports mathematically engineered money that anyone on earth can use without asking permission

Crypto is the wild world of fintech startups. The majority of cryto tokens are worthless, some projects are interesting but none have solved meaningful problems

Bitcoin solves a major problem we all face: how do we store our wealth using a form of money that preserves our energy and cannot be corrupted


------ Financial literacy

The ability to understand not just how to manage money but to understand how money actually works

Money is a tool humans created in order to facilitate trade at scale

Many forms of money have existed over time and for the past 50 years we have been using a flawed form of money that is currently failing

It's easier to accept that your current money works and simply continue using it

It's much harder to set down a path of inquiry to understand money from first principles so you can evaluate the effect fiat is having on you


------ The keystone pillar

Keystone: of crucial importance (the apex stone in masonry that holds everything together)

From my perspective, financial literacy is the gatekeeper element to health

I'm going to to my best at explaining the rationale of how I came to that conclusion



------ What is money?

Put simply, money is how we store our time so we can spend it on things we need in future

It's a tool that exists to help us trade with one another at scale so we can move beyond the limitations of barter

Barter works in small communities but in todays world where we've exceeded dunbars number, a more effective tool is needed

Eddie Ferry and have been recording Bitcoin education podcasts and one of the episodes we did is titled "what is money?"

In that episode we cover money from first principles and talk about the functions and properties of money

If you understand what makes a form of money good or bad from first principles, you are able to make better decisions for yourself

------ Health requires time

Let's start with a fundamental assumption: improving our health requires time

Time to understand what health means to us, time to explore and experiment so we can make productive changes to improve our health

If time is being stolen from us, little is left for health and it often gets pushed aside

Common obstacle for people I speak with: I don't have enough time to exercise, cook my food, learn about health etc.


------ Fiat debasement

How does fiat (government controlled money) steal our time?

Debasement: to reduce the value of something

Simply: When central banks create more money, it makes the money we own less valuable

The average annual increase in money supply in Canada floats around 7% historically

This means that each year, our purchasing power decreases by about 7% if we hold cash

If we don't get a 7% raise, we are effectively falling behind in real terms

Falling behind: losing relative purchasing power which means we must spend more time working or take bigger risks with our money

Money creation is a form of taxation that most people are not aware of

How we feel it: "the squeeze" less time for ourselves, for hobbies, for being with friends/family

Jan 20-21 the money creation in Canada went into overdrive and our central bank created 18.5% more money

Houses skyrocketed in price, everything around us got more expensive and essentially 20% of our wealth was stolen

This brings us to Bitcoin


------ Bitcoin protects your time

I view the use case for Bitcoin right now as a savings technology

Saving: spending slightly less than you make. Storing that excess in a sound monetary tool so you can spend it in future and preserve purcahsing power

Bitcoin is engineered money nobody controls

Solves the fiat problems by taking the humans out of it

Replaced central banks with a protocol that is predictable, transparent and fair

Until we protect our time with sound money, we will continue to have less and less of it available 

You can understand all 5 pillars but if you don't have the time to work on improving them, little changes happen

Step 1: understand money and begin learning about bitcoin so you can form your own opinions and judgement of money


------- Experiments: 

- Reflection: assess your relationship with money. How do you view it?
- List the functions of money
- List the properties of money?
- Explain your understanding of money to a friend/family member
- Download a Bitcoin wallet, buy a small amount of bitcoin ($20), send a small amount to someone and have them send it back to you
