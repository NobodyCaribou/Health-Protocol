------ Intro:

Hello to everyone listening and welcome to the Foot Nerd Program. 

I’m Nick [and I’m Ruth] and we have the honor of teaching this first lesson of the 2022 Foot Nerd Program

Thank you for being here. Thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health and for trusting us with 360 hours of your
time.

Our aim is to share everything we know to prepare you for the journey as best we can. 

We aren’t teaching you information. We’re teaching you a framework how to become your own health scientist and we share our current perspective 
in hopes that it will be challenged and replaced over time. 

We are on Slack at least once a week. Have a question about the lesson? message us. Want to contribute? submit a pull request on github. 

Let's dig in.


------ Our Core Values: 

Responsibility (to health)

Curiosity (to understand)

(Ruth) Playfulness (not taking ourselves too seriously)
- - how do we do that? 
- self awareness
- observe the world around us
- willingness to explore 
- cultivating imagination is necessary
- actively remembering how to feel a sense of wonder & innocence

Commitment (to the process of health)

(Ruth) Open-mindedness
- define 
- not paying lip service 
- taking an honest inventory


------ Critical thinking:

What is it? (*key component of the scientific method)
- the analysis of facts to form a judgement
- a skill that must be sustematically cultivated through practice
- requires work (to gather information & analyze it, share it, review it)

Why is it important?
- a principle underlying our best method used to avoid fooling ourselves
- because if we aren't thinking for ourselves, we are trusting our health with someone else ill equipped for the job (because only we can do it)
- because truth is important

How do we foster it?
- through a culture where we hold each other accountable to being critical thinkers
- by applying it in our own lives (our health process, community discussions)

 


------ Proof of work:

Your daily health log (timestamped)
Log definition: an official record of events during a voyage. A record of your health voyage

Examples:
- what I did
- what I learned, key insights
- what challenged me
- a big win
- what I want to do next




------ Experiments:

the scientific method is your scaffolding for constructing experiments. Each lesson will have recommended experiments (ranked from nano 
[tiny] to macro [huge]) and we welcome suggestions from all nerds that we can share with the tribe. 

fundamentally: asking questions. Ideally, asking better and better questions as you learn

make an observation
ask a question
form a hypothesis that answers the question
make a prediction based on the hypothesis
do an experiment to test the prediction
analyze the results
[choice] 
1) hypothesis is correct
2) hypothesis is incorrect (ask a different question, revise hypothesis, try again]

Share results


EXAMPLE:

Observation: My toaster doesn’t work.
Question: Is something wrong with my electrical outlet?
Hypothesis: If something is wrong with the outlet, my coffeemaker also won’t work when plugged into it.
Experiment: I plug my coffeemaker into the outlet.
Result: My coffeemaker works!
Conclusion: My electrical outlet works, but my toaster still won’t toast my bread.
Refine the hypothesis: My toaster is broken.
From this point, the process would be repeated with a refined hypothesis.


HEALTH related EXAMPLE:

observation: I feel tired when i wake up and have low energy to start the day
question: perhaps my sleep quality is poor
hypothesis: if I improve my evening routine maybe my sleep quality will improve and i will be less tired waking up
experiment: no screens 1 hour before bed, consistent bedtime, downregulation routine
result: after 7 days i'm much less tired waking up
conclusion: a better evening routine results in more restful sleep


------ Accountability:

- self
- social (family, pod - whale pod, not matrix pod)
- learning partner (be clear on the type and level of accountability you're seeking)



------ Creating purpose: (Ruth) 

- why did you commit to this process?
- what motivates you to complete this?
- what is health and why is it important to you?


------ Program structure
Content layers

Layer 1 - Audio lesson, framework, lesson notes, experiments
Layer 2 - Stories, conversations & beautiful disagreements between nerds (topic specific)
Layer 3 - sources used by teacher to craft lesson, resources for going deeper (podcasts, videos, articles, books)

Structure:

- 20% information (lessons, resources)
- 60% mindful experimentation (action oriented) [ex: making a meal from scratch, 30min walk, going to bed 30min earlier]
- 20% reflection (daily log, synthesis)

Each lesson is 10 hours - 2hrs learning information, 6 hrs experimenting, 2 hrs health log (10min per day, 20min log review on 10th day)

lesson 1.1 Experiments:

- Start a log (digital or paper)
- Intention statement: when will I write in my log each day?
- Crafting your daily hour (when, where, making up lost days)
- Design accountability prompts (notebook location, phone alert, telling family members)
- Do a zoom call to meet your partner, learn three interesting things about them


------ Planning your journey with behaviour design

- Create a recipe for your daily hour (when, where, blocking off time)
- Health log ritual (start or end of day)

------ Outro:

We hope you found this lesson helpful and took some notes in your log.

Listening to this is proof of work. 

Thank you for taking responsibility for your health and we hope you connect with your podmates about this lesson.

Ciao for now friends
