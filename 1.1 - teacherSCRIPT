------ Intro:

Hello to everyone listening and welcome to the Foot Nerd Program. 

I’m Nick [and I’m Ruth] and we have the honor of teaching this first lesson of the 2022 Foot Nerd Program

Thank you for being here. Thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health and for trusting us with 360 hours of your
time and your enrolment fees. 

Our aim is to share everything we know to prepare you for the journey as best we can. 

We aren’t teaching you information. We’re teaching you a framework how to become your own health scientist and we share our current perspective 
in hopes that it will be challenged and replaced over time. 

We are on Slack at least once a week. Have a question about the lesson? message us. Want to contribute? submit a pull request on github. 

Let's dig in.


------ Our Core Values: 

Responsibility (to health)

Curiosity (to understand)

Playfulness (not taking ourselves too seriously)

Commitment (to the process of health)

Open-mindedness


------ Critical thinking:

What is it? (*key component of the scientific method)

Why is it important?

How do we foster it?


------ Proof of work:

Your daily health log (timestamped)
Log definition: an official record of events during a voyage. A record of your health voyage

Examples:
- what I did
- what I learned
- what challenged me
- a big win
- what I want to do next


------ Experiments:
scientific method

fundamentally: asking questions. Ideally, asking better and better questions as you learn

make an observation
ask a question
form a hypothesis that answers the question
make a prediction based on the hypothesis
do an experiment to test the prediction
analyze the results
[choice] 
1) hypothesis is correct
2) hypothesis is incorrect (ask a different question, revise hypothesis, try again]

Share results


EXAMPLE:

Observation: My toaster doesn’t work.
Question: Is something wrong with my electrical outlet?
Hypothesis: If something is wrong with the outlet, my coffeemaker also won’t work when plugged into it.
Experiment: I plug my coffeemaker into the outlet.
Result: My coffeemaker works!
Conclusion: My electrical outlet works, but my toaster still won’t toast my bread.
Refine the hypothesis: My toaster is broken.
From this point, the process would be repeated with a refined hypothesis.

This is your scaffolding for constructing experiments. Each lesson will have recommended experiments (ranked from nano to macro) and we welcome 
suggestions from all nerds that we can share with the tribe. 


------ Accountability:

- self
- social (family, pod - whale pod, not matrix pod)
- learning partner (be clear on the type and level of accountability you're seeking)


------ Creating purpose:

- why did you commit to this process?
- what motivates you to complete this?
- what is health and why is it important to you?



Content layers

Layer 1 - Audio lesson, framework, lesson notes, experiments
Layer 2 - Stories, conversations & beautiful disagreements between nerds (topic specific)
Layer 3 - sources used by teacher to craft lesson, resources for going deeper (podcasts, videos, articles, books)

--------------------------
Experiments: (ranked from nano to macro)

- Start a log (digital or paper)
- Intention statement: when will I write in my log each day?
- Accountability (prompts, partner)

- Do a zoom call to meet your partner, learn three interesting things about them
- Say hi to your podmembers in Slack
- Crafting your daily hour (when, where, making up lost days)
- Daily log: Start a notebook, design your daily log into your day


------ Outro:

We hope you found this lesson helpful and took some notes in your log.

Listening to this is proof of work. 

Thank you for taking responsibility for your health and we hope you connect with your podmates about this lesson.

Ciao for now friends
