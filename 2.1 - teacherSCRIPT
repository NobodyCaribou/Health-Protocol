------ Intro: [Ruth]

By now you've had some time with the material. You know us, Ruth & Nick. 

We welcome you to lesson 2.1 - First principles

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

Today's objective is to unpack the idea of first principles to provide a framework for laying down a solid foundation for realistically incorporating healthy practices into our lives.

If you have questions about the lesson, feel free to message us on Slack and if you want to contribute you can submit a pull request on github. 

Let's dig in.



------ First principles: defined
[Ruth]
- first principles are the base layer assumptions that we accept to be true (things we know for sure to be true)
- a statement that is accepted as true and serves as the foundation or premise for building further reasoning
- when we go to school, our education usually begins with 1st principles: math, philosophy, science
- in this lesson, we focus on 1st principles of human physiology
- the base layer principles we accept as true when it comes to building our health foundation
- we typically trust others who seem to be authorities on "health" without an understanding of the underlying principles of what our bodies are designed to do
- 1st principles in human physiology are not difficult to understand, intuitive and empowering
- in today's lesson we  discuss SAID principle, self regulation, self organizing and self healing
- when you understand the "how" and you provide the "why", nothing is lef to conjecture, you have the tools you need always for any health experiment
- you ought to feel empowered just because you have a human body that is designed to organize itself, heal itself and seeks to balance itself at all times. Amazing
- NickyPop, take it away :) 

[Nick]
- first principle: basic assumption that cannot be deduced any further
- Aristotle: the first basis from which a thing is known
- first principles are the base layer assumptions that we use to guide our process of discovering truth
- consensus agreement on first principles enables coherent collective sensemaking
- health can be complex
- starting with first principles allows us to break down the complexity of health into basic elements we know to be true 
- we can then begin reassembling health while shedding poor assumptions or reasoning to discover truth
- first principles thinking enables novel solutions because we don't reason by analogy by trusting the work of others

------ Tree of understanding [Nick]

A framework for first principles thinking

A hierarchy of salience (for understanding what matters most)

Roots: our identity, values, level of self awareness, 
Trunk: first principles (SAID, self organizing, self healing)
Branches: heuristics, root cause awareness
Leaves: specific, contextual knowledge (facts, studies, diets, exercise programs)

We must be mindful of the roots, agree on the trunk, discuss the branches and use leaves as data for our individual experiments

We can compare leaves but we must focus on the trunk. Focus on the fundamentals

Help each other grow strong roots, focus on the trunk and avoid getting caught up in the leaves

Conventional school taught me leaves. What I wish they taught was the trunk so I could discover my own leaves

Contextual specifics have less relevance


------- SAID principle
[Ruth]
- Specific adaptation to imposed demand
- the principle that the human body will impartially adapt to whatever inputs we give it

[Nick] 

Impartial is a really important element in what you said Ruth. Let's double click on that

Concept of unintentional negative adaptations: being good at sitting, being good at being distracted

View everything through the SAID principle and you discover a lot of clarity


[Ruth]
- astronauts and microgravity/advertisements for zero gravity chairs and beds



------ Self organizing, self healing 
[Nick]

Self organizing system of systems: The optimizes perfectly based on the inputs it receives

Challenge: understand the inputs I give to my body and the optimizations they produce. Determine inputs that align with health

Self healing: Our natural default state is health. Natural inputs are required to achieve a state of health

By understanding what natural inputs are and exposing ourselves to them, the body restores health naturally

Example: skin healing after a cut, injury healing (calf)

We are healing machines

The journey of health is about writing your own user manual for your machine that is tailored to the life you choose to live



[Ruth]
- we now accept the principles that the body is self healing and self organizing 
- and we recognize we'd like to improve the inputs we've given our bodies but it has been a long time since the body received optimal inputs (food, movement, thoughts etc)
- give it time and recognize there will be discomfort while the body is adapting and changing
- Nick talk about the role of pain?

[Nick]

Pain is a signal designed to stimulate change

A warning that we are providing the wrong inputs for optimal organization and healing

A hint from our bodies that must be listened to and learned from in order to nudge us in the right direction

Will cover pain more deeply in a future lesson

For the purposes of this lesson: pain (physical, mental, spiritual) is one of many feedback signals tht orients us towards healing


------- Root cause understanding

To solve a problem we must first understand the problem

It's better to spend time thinking deeply about the root of a problem than to think of solutions to the wrong problem

Symptoms are often obvious. Root cause requires deeper layers of thinking and reasoning with first principles

Use experiments to confirm/disconfirm root cause hypothesis


------ Trusting your physiology
[Ruth]
- if we weren't bombarded with external cues about why we shouldn't trust our physiology, it would be obvious and natural to us
- because of confusion, we must actively build a model of understanding so we can create positive adaptations that work for our wellbeing
- makes it so much easier to trust your physiology when you take a small amount of time to understand and recognize 1st principles operating in your own body

[Nick]

Trust that your body knows exactly what to so. It's a massively reassuring mindset

Focus on optimizing inputs and trust that your physiology will be working 24/7 365 to adapt to them


==> lesson 2.1 Experiments:
- Explain the tree of understanding to a family member, partner
- Apply the SAID principle to an area of your body you wish to improve

- [Ruth] 
- make an entry in your POW log - list as many events in your life where the SAID prinicple was working on your physiology
- example: when i was in 4th grade, i had a cast on my foot leg and the muscles were atrophied for a month or so 



------ Outro:

We hope you found this lesson helpful and took some notes in your log.

Listening to this is proof of work. 

Thank you for taking responsibility for your health and we hope you connect with your learning partner and podmates to discuss what we covered in this lesson.

Ciao for now friends
