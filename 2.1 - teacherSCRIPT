------ Intro: [Ruth]

By now you've had some time with the material. You know us, Ruth & Nick. 

We welcome you to lesson 2.1 - First principles

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

Today's objective is to unpack the idea of first principles to provide a framework for laying down a solid foundation for realistically incorporating healthy practices into our lives.

If you have questions about the lesson, feel free to message us on Slack and if you want to contribute you can submit a pull request on github. 

Let's dig in.

Framework: [Nick]


------ Define 1st Principles: things we know to be true
[Ruth]
- first principles are the base layer assumptions that we accept to be true
- a statement that is accepted as true and serves as the foundation or premise for building further reasoning
- when we go to school, our education usually begins with 1st principles: math, philosophy, science
- in this lesson, we focus on 1st principles of human physiology
- the base layer principles we accept as true when it comes to building our health foundation
- we typically trust others who seem to be authorities on "health" without an understanding of the underlying principles of what our bodies are designed to do
- 1st principles in human physiology are not difficult to understand, intuitive and empowering
- in today's lesson we  discuss SAID principle, self regulation, self organizing and self healing
- NickyPop, take it away :) 

------ Tree of understanding [Nick]




------- SAID principle- 
[Ruth]
- Specific adaptation to imposed demand
- the principle that the human body will impartially adapt to whatever inputs we give it

[Nick] further explains

[Ruth]
- astronauts and microgravity/advertisements for zero gravity chairs and beds




------Self organizing, self healing




-------Root cause understanding



------Trusting your physiology
[Ruth]
- its so much easier to trust your physiology when you take a small amount of time to understand and recognize 1st principles operating in your own body
- superintuitive too 


==> lesson 2.1 Experiments:
- Explain the tree of understanding to a family member, partner
- Apply the SAID principle to an area of your body you wish to improve

- [Ruth] 
- make an entry in your POW log - list as many events in your life where the SAID prinicple was working on your physiology
- example: when i was in 4th grade, i had a cast on my foot leg and the muscles were atrophied for a month or so
