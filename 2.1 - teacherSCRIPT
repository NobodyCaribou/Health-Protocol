Framework: [Nick]


------ Define 1st Principles: things we know to be true
[Ruth]
- first principles are the base layer assumptions that we accept to be true
- a statement that is accepted as true and serves as the foundation or premise for building further reasoning
- when we go to school, our education usually begins with 1st principles: math, philosophy, science
- in this lesson, we focus on 1st principles of human physiology
- the base layer principles we accept as true when it comes to building our health foundation
- we typically trust others who seem to be authorities on "health" without an understanding of the underlying principles of what our bodies are designed to do
- 1st principles in human physiology are not difficult to understand, intuitive and empowering
- in today's lesson we  discuss SAID principle, self regulation, self organizing and self healing
- NickyPop, take it away :)
