Experiments (nano to macro)

- Start a log (digital or paper)
- Intention statement: when will I do my daily log each day?
- Design accountability prompts (notebook location, phone alert, telling family members)
- Introduce yourseld to your partner, do a zoom call to meet them, learn three interesting things about them
- Crafting your daily hour (when, where, making up lost days)

- Become a Mover
This project is all about working towards changing your daily movement behaviours so that you can eventually consider yourself an active person (aka a “mover”). 
Lets start by defining what being a “mover” means: Someone who spends the majority of their waking hours moving (defined as not being in a single position for more than 20 minutes at a time)
For example: There are 24 hours in a day, 8 of those are set aside for sleep/sleep prep, so you have 16 hours remaining. 
Spending at least 8 of those hours moving (includes ground living with frequent position changes) should be a goal for everyone and as Nerds we need to BE the example. 
Completing this project will require a commitment to constant improvement. 
Working to find opportunities to move more and sit less everyday is the work needed to then help others work towards doing the same thing. 
Whether its creating a dynamic workstation at the office, choosing to walk instead of drive, spending time on the floor instead of the couch - small changes compound over time in a big way. 
It’s not about being perfect, its about being better everyday. Start by eliminating the low hanging fruit - the sitting you do at home on the couch or in the office that can easily be replaced with time standing, in a squat or resting on the floor with frequent position changes. 
Note: completion of this project will mean taking some daily sample recordings of how much time you spend sitting and working towards being an active person. 
For some this project will already be satisfied based on their current lifestyle but for others it will require consistent work and regular examination to wean away from sedentary behaviours which are the norm in the modern office today.
