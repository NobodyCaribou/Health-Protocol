Movement Experiment
- Hip training routine - experiment for the next 10 days and record the effects in your log: https://youtu.be/bG7ZghGbBKM
- Assess your Squat position - experiment with the information below and record your reflections in your log

- Try a barefoot (bodyweight, unassisted, heels on the floor, feet parallel), relaxed squat position with your feet together (touching) for 60 seconds. 
Tips:
- Step 1 is to get a baseline trial under your belt and record a note to begin your squat log 
- (date, how it feels, amount of time you can hold it for, where you feel the restriction)
- Don’t feel bad if it’s really hard or you immediately fall back on your bum
- Be gentle with yourself as you learn
- Embrace the process of continual improvement. If you work on this daily it will surely improve over time
- To complete this you need the hardware to external rotate your hips and the software to shift your weight into your hips
- Never work through sharp pain
- Re-test the position after doing some accessory work to see if it changed your comfort in the position

Accessory work that can help:
- 90/90 hip external rotation work
- Hinges
- Balance work
- Spending time in the position holding onto support or using a weight to counter balance you.
