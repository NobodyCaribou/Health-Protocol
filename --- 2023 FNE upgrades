Upgrading the Foot Nerd Experience

Questions:
- Is the current version too long? too intense? too detailed?
- Can we shorten the experience without eliminating important elements?
- Does the digital nature of the experience reduce motivation?
- What causes people to lose momentum or fall off track?

Input from nerds:
- Foot lesson should come earlier


2023 framework idea:

28 weeks?
