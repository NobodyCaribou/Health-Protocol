Framework:
- Our personal spiritual stories to leave breadcrumbs for other Foot Nerds to contribute
- How does sprituality relate to health?
- What do you believe in? How does one organize one's reality for oneself?
- Religion is simply a term to describe what we worship
- There tends to be fear around having these kinds of conversations
- How does this topic relate to health? We tend to worship what we value 
- If we don't choose our values, we tend to worship false idols or money, possesions, beauty etc.
- Asking deeper questions: What do I value? How do I live? Where can I turn when I feel small in the face of life?
- The benefits of sharing with our communities our experiences in faith, spirituality and death have strong ties to health in our
bodies, the people around and our communities
- The courage of the individual who shares their personal story in the community creates a trickle effect of courage within the community
- In sharing our stories, we hope to inspire you to share yours, keeping the thread of cohesion between us alive = Community
- Sharing our experience through story is a valuable health tool sometimes considered "internal hygiene" 


Experiments (nano to macro)
- Gardening: Can you go to the garden,plant or tend to something growing there with the intention of that being a prayer? Reflect and share your experience.
- Before a morning coffee or other ritual that you love, take 6 slow deep breaths. Use your hand to trace the breath in and the breath
out. If you rush, begin again. Then ask for wisdom to greet your day. Thank the earth and say a blessing for those you love. Finish by
say a thank you for the coffee, water or other beverage you are enjoying. Go as deep as you can into the detail of the "thank you"
- Remember a prayer from your childhood, if there is one and revisit it. Write about your experience in your log and share it with others
- Go to a faith service in your community that you've never been to before. Reflect and share your experience.
