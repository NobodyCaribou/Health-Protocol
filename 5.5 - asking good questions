Creators: Foot Nerds

Framework:
- The importance of asking questions rather than giving answers
- Sharing our experience to inspire another to find their own answers
- Our job is to help others become their own scientists, do their own experiments and find for themselves, what works
- The questions we ask ourselves can be the template we use for asking others the same questions



Audio lesson notes:
- detailed notes and timestamps from the audio lesson


Experiments (nano to macro)
- Reflect on the questions you ask yourself about your health? What experiments have you done to help answer those questions?
- What has your experience been around giving answers and asking questions instead?
- Practice with another Foot Nerd or friend having a health conversation. Practice asking better questions. How did it go?
- What are your tendencies to give answers vs asking questions. Reflect and share your answers in your log or with another Nerd
