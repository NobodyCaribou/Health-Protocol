Hello Teachers

Thank you for contributing your wisdom to this constantly adapting Health Procotol we are co-creating

To compensate teachers for their work, we are using the Bitcoin network to send payments

Below are instructions on how to setup Muun wallet on your mobile device so you can begin receiving payments

We will begin using on chain addresses and progress to using lightning (more technical but better privacy and lower transaction fees)

40% of Foot Nerd Experience (FNE) revenue is paid to teachers based on the number of lessons they are currently teaching

This 40% allocation is called "teaching revenue" and is divided by the number of lessons (eventually 36 lessons x 2 teachers per lesson)

If you are currently teaching 1 lesson, you are entitled to 1/(#lessons x2) of the teaching revenue (for 72 lessons = 1.39%)

If you are currently teaching 4 lessons, you are entitled to 4/(#lessons x2) of the teaching revenue (for 72 lessons = 5.56%)

Payments will be made monthly on the 21st day (after 30 day holding period in case of refunds)

Example: Payment deadline for April pod is March 21st, Payment made to teachers on April 21st
