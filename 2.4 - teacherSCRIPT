------ Intro: [Malin or Nick]

Hello beautiful humans

Welcome to lesson 2.4

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

Today's lesson is covering the mind. We want to share our experience with mental health and some of the principles we implement in our lives

If you have questions about the lesson or want to contribute resources or a layer 2 conversation, please message us on slack

Let's dig in.


------- Teacher stories

Malin's experience with mental health:

Another Foot nerd once told me that I have a too strong mind. Other people have told me that too - that I think too much. And I kind of agree sometimes.

My challenge is that I tend to shut down what I feel in favor of what I think. Or maybe rather that I let my thinking overrule what I intuitively feel. 

I express it as trying to feel with my mind. 

Which has been a coping strategy many times. Through serious illness, and other difficulties. And it has given me a strong mind. But challenges with allowing it 

not to be busy. And being more aware of when my mind is playing me tricks.

Awareness is key to mental health for me. Both awareness and knowledge of how the brain works, and awareness about your own mind. Having distance to it and not

always believe what you think. Being able to watch how I think in order to be bigger than my thoughts. And always being mindful of the possibility that I may be wrong,

as Bj√∂rn Natthiko Lindeblad says

Being present, fully present is also key. My inspiration: my kids. It is said that kids up to the age of six is in a constant state of meditation. I learn so much from them.

Being fully in the moment. Not hold on to anger and arguments. Express what is on your mind in a clear way etc.



Nick's experience with mental health:

A long time struggle to harness a busy mind (aka high entropy mind)

Many years of training my brain to be constantly solving problems (very productive but came at a cost - a busy, distracted mind, sleep & relationship issues)

I love animals and find them fascinating. Always present, fully authentic. Never caught in thought, never hold grudges, products of their environment

Saying in animal training: no bad dogs, only uninformed (/untrained) owners

Same in mental health: No bad minds, only untrained owners. Depression, anxiety - not broken minds, only uninformed owners

Current perspective: working to cultivate an ordered mind 

An ordered home is the result of careful action and time cleaning it/mindfulness when at home. A neglected home is chaotic, messy, cluttered

Mental health to me is about having an ordered mind and recognizing when I'm neglecting it

It's abouyt spending daily energy to harness chaos into order so I can maintain good mental health and sustainably contribute value to the world

When in in doubt, limit inputs (spend time in solitude, clarity always comes)

Primary modern obstacle of the mind: information overload. Required skill: information parsing (noise vs. signal)

Trying to figure out what we need to know and what we can ignore can be exhausting if we don't have clear values



------ The mind as the frontline of health

I've found the mind to be at the frontline of health. Both a catalyst and potentially a limiting element

Your thoughts on this Malin?

Our mind is the basis of everything we experience in life. We are the products of our thoughts - but sometimes our thoughts can be too dominating, 

which is also important to remember.


According to the stoics, our mind is the asset that must be worked on most and understood best. I definitely agree with this

Health begins with understanding our mind and using it to our advantage when working to radically improve our health

How we think, why we think the way we do - basics of the brain and how we can work with that (prefrontal cortex, limbic brain, brain prone to focus on the negative - 

historical survival)



------ Mental health: defined

Student experiment: write your definition of mental health

Malins definition: awareness of how your mind works and being able to work with it, not against it. ability to observe your mind and be present rather than being 

absorbed by your mind.

Nicks definition: the ability to drop into the present moment with a calm mind, able to meet challenges productively. A daily process of improving self awareness



------ Mindfulness

Define mindfulness: a state of clear, nonjudgemental, undistracted attention on purpose to the contents of our mind in the present

Presence, paying full attention to the current experience instead of drifting away into thought

Short times, many times

Shallow vs. deep attention

Attention: delectively concentrating on something

Shallow: weakly held superficial concentration, attention switching between multiple things

Deep: concentration on a single thing, undivided attention, undistracted and focused on a single meaningful task

Distractions nudge us towards shallow attention and frequent switching



------ Mental training & solitude

Physical training is popular, we know it works

Mental training gets much less attention but is incredibly important and has strong impact on physical training

Training focus, concentration, observing our thoughts/emotions/feelings with curiosity to understand them, affirmations to recalibrate your brain (neuroplasticity)

Solitude: free of input from other minds



------ RAIN

Coined by Michele McDonald, popularized by Tara Brach and Judson Brewer

A tool to understand and change our habits

Recognition, acceptance, interest, non-identification

Qualities of attention that make up a complete moment of mindfulness. An alternative to blindly reacting. Offers us a choice of how to respond

Applying RAIN as a tool to help us navigate challenging situations and emotions

Recognize what is going on
Allow the experience to be there, just as it is
Investigate with kindness
By not identifying with the experience, we allow ourselves to maintain a natural awareness

STOP: Stop, Think, Orient, Plan - in more intense situations when you actively need to give your mind/brain a tool to pause and start over



------ Reframing

Events are neutral until we place a judgement on them. Becoming aware of our choice in judging events

A conscious choice to interpret things as "good" or "bad"

Chinese proverb - "Maybe"

Framing as a mental habit. Reinforcing adaptive neural circuits

Examples: ice falling on car, cutting my toe in the forest, travel plans cancelled, disease as a catalyst for major positive health changes



------- Meditation

Many types of meditation (active, point focused, seated)

Challenges of meditation - and prejudices about meditation - thoughts are the sweat of meditation (Light Watkins)

Starting out: waking up app to get 5min daily consistent, SL beam work to train my focus, graduate to no App, 2x/day 21 min session

Feeling good about simply showing up for min daily without distraction. Regardless of what happens, your thoughts, etc

Inbox zero concept: start with a monkey mind. Very busy mind. Huge backlog of emails unopened. Begin working through them, eventually get to inbox zero

Beach ball concept: thoughts are like a beach ball in water - if you try to suppress it under water, it will fly/jump up if control is lost, but if you allow

it to float freely, it will calmly land on the surface of the water

Muddy water concept: walking through water, stirring up mud and debris (= thoughts), which needs time to settle back down again so that the water becomes clear -

give you mind time to settle, especially if you have a mind that is used to being constantly busy. Try to not see it as something you perform, but rather an 

inner shift

Checkin in on my dopamine system (I have found a correlation in my life between meditation difficulty and dopamine deficit)

Instant access to a stream of dopamine in the modern world (apps, food, netflix, drugs)

Recognizing that with constant dopamine generation comes a down regulation of receptors (homeostatic response)

This down regulation keeps us needing more and more dopamine just to avoid pain

If being in solitude and focusing my mind is difficult, It can be an indicator that I have been in a dopamine surplus and must recalibrate my system



------- Mental hygiene

Daily self checkin

Brain recovery: periods of reduced inputs

High quality sleep (hen and egg)

Dental hygiene: reducing refined sugars + daily cleaning
Mental hygiene: reducing noise + daily cleaning (meditation)


------- Experiments: 

- How do you define mental health?
- What are your thoughts on your current mental health
- 3 concrete learning objectives for this lesson
- Log the experience of applying RAIN, create prompts to apply RAIN more regularly
- Daily meditation experiment (2021 program: 5 daily minutes for 30 days straight)
- Spend 24 hours in complete solitude (no books, podcasts, others, phone etc)


------ Outro:

We hope you found this lesson helpful and took some notes in your log

Listening to this is proof of work

Thank you for taking responsibility for your health and we hope you connect with your learning partner and podmates to discuss what we covered in this lesson

Ciao for now friends
