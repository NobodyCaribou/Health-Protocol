------- Teacher stories

Malin's experience with mental health:

Another Foot nerd once told me that I have a too strong mind. Other people have told me that too - that I think too much. And I kind of agree sometimes.

My challenge is that I tend to shut down what I feel in favor of what I think. Or maybe rather that I let my thinking overrule what I intuitively feel. 

I express it as trying to feel with my mind. 

Which has been a coping strategy many times. Through serious illness, and other difficulties. And it has given me a strong mind. But challenges with allowing it 

not to be busy. And being more aware of when my mind is playing me tricks.

Awareness is key to mental health for me. Both awareness and knowledge of how the brain works, and awareness about your own mind. Having distance to it and not

always believe what you think. Being able to watch how I think in order to be bigger than my thoughts. And always being mindful of the possibility that I may be wrong,

as Bj√∂rn Natthiko Lindeblad says

Being present, fully present is also key. My inspiration: my kids. It is said that kids up to the age of six is in a constant state of meditation. I learn so much from them.

Being fully in the moment. Not hold on to anger and arguments. Express what is on your mind in a clear way etc.



Nick's experience with mental health:

Working to control a busy mind

Many years of training my brain to be constantly solving problems (very productive but came at a cost - a busy, distracted mind, sleep & relationship issues)

I love animals and find them fascinating. Always present, fully authentic. Never caught in thought, never hold grudges, products of their environment

No bad dogs, only uninformed (/untrained) owners

No bad minds, only untrained owners. Depression, anxiety - no bad minds, uninformed owners

An ordered mind 

An ordered home is the result of careful action and time cleaning it/mindfulness when at home. A neglected home is chaotic, messy, cluttered

Mental health to me is about having an ordered mind and recognizing when I'm neglecting it

When in in doubt, limit inputs (spend time in solitude, clarity always comes)

High entropy mind (because I trained it to be like that over my life), now working to harness the chaos into order (healthier, sustainable)

Primary modern obstacle of the mind: information overload. Required skill: information parsing (noise vs. signal)

Trying to figure out what we need to know and what we can ignore is exhausting



------ The mind as the frontline of health

Our mind is the basis of everything we experience in life. We are the products of our thoughts

According to the stoics, our mind is the asset that must be worked on most and understood best. I definitely agree with this

Health begins with understanding our mind

How we think, why we think the way we do

Our actions often stem from our thoughts


------ Mental health: defined

Student experiment: write your definition of mental health

Malins definition: awareness of how your mind works and being able to work with it, not against it. ability to observe your mind and be present rather than being 

absorbed by your mind.

Nicks definition: the ability to drop into the present moment with a calm mind, able to meet challenges productively. A daily process of improving self awareness


------ Mindfulness

Define mindfulness: a state of clear, nonjudgemental, undistracted attention on purpose to the contents of our mind in the present

Presence, paying full attention to the current experience instead of drifting away into thought

Short times, many times

Shallow vs. deep attention


------ Mental training & solitude

Physical training is popular, we know it works

Mental training gets much less attention but is incredibly important

Training focus, concentration, observing our thoughts/emotions/feelings with curiosity to understand them

Solitude: free of input from other minds


------ RAIN

Coined by Michele McDonald, popularized by Tara Brach and Judson Brewer

A tool to understand and change our habits

Recognize, accept, investigate, nurture

Applying RAIN to challenging situations, cravings, intense feelings/emotions


------ Reframing

Events are neutral until we place a judgement on them. Becoming aware of our choice in judging events

A conscious choice to interpret things as "good" or "bad"

Chinese proverb - "Maybe"

Framing as a mental habit. Reinforcing adaptive neural circuits

Examples: ice falling on car, cutting my toe in the forest, travel plans cancelled, disease as a catalyst for major positive health changes


------- Meditation

Types of meditation (active, point focused, seated)

Challenges of meditation - and prejudices about meditation - thoughts are the sweat of meditation (Light Watkins)

Starting out: waking up app to get 5min daily consistent, SL beam work to train my focus, graduate to no App, 2x/day 21 min session

Feeling good about simply showing up for min daily without distraction. Regardless of what happens, your thoughts, etc

Inbox zero concept: start with a monkey mind. Very busy mind. Huge backlog of emails unopened. Begin working through them, eventually get to inbox zero

Checkin in on my dopamine system (I have found a correlation in my life between meditation difficulty and dopamine deficit)


------- Mental hygiene

Daily self checkin

Brain recovery: periods of reduced inputs

High quality sleep

Dental hygiene: reducing refined sugar + daily cleaning
Mental hygiene: reducing noise + daily cleaning (meditation)

------- Experiments: 

- How do you define mental health?
- What are your thoughts on your current mental health
- 3 concrete learning objectives for this lesson
- Log the experience of applying RAIN, create prompts to apply RAIN more regularly
- Daily meditation experiment (2021 program: 5 daily minutes for 30 days straight)
- Spend 24 hours in complete solitude (no books, podcasts, others, phone etc)
