Let's dig in.


------- Teacher stories

Malin's experience with mental health

Nick's experience with mental health



------ The mind as the frontline of health

Our mind is the basis of everything we experience in life. We are the products of our thoughts

According to the stoics, our mind is the asset that must be worked on most and understood best. I definitely agree with this

Health begins with understanding our mind

How we think, why we think the way we do

Our actions often stem from our thoughts


------ Mental health: defined

Student experiment: write your definition of mental health

Malins definition: 

Nicks definition:


------ Mindfulness

Define mindfulness: a state of clear, nonjudgemental, undistracted attention on purpose to the contents of our mind in the present

Presence, paying full attention to the current experience instead of drifting away into thought

Short times, many times

Shallow vs. deep attention


------ Mental training & solitude

Physical training is popular, we know it works

Mental training gets much less attention but is incredibly important

Solitude: free of input from other minds


------ RAIN

Coined by Michele McDonald, popularized by Tara Brach and Judson Brewer

A tool to understand and change our habits

Recognize, accept, investigate, nurture


------ Reframing

Events are neutral until we place a judgement on them

Chinese proverb - "Maybe"

A conscious choice to interpret things as "good" or "bad"

Framing as a mental habit


------- Meditation

Types of meditation (active, point focused, seated)

Challenges of meditation

Balance work as training wheels

Daily self checkin

Brain recovery: periods of reduced inputs

Sleep
