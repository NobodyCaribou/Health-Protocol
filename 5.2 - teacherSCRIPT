Framework:
- Ruth & Nick share perspectives
- Feelings & emotions defined
- Emotions and health
- Emotional intelligence
- Expanding vocabulary
- RULER

[Ruth Notes:]
- Distinguishing between the thinking brain and the feeling body
- Acknowledging that feeling/emotional body is really driving the car (car = consciousness)
- the thinking brain is trying to give directions but if the feeling part of us doesn't like the idea, it will not drive us there
- the feeling brain does what feels good and the thinking brain tries to justify it in order to not have dissonance
- self awareness is understanding the feeling/emotional parts of ourselves well enough so the thinking brain can negotiate the tiny habits

------ Intro:

Hello beautiful humans

Welcome to lesson 5.2

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

Today's lesson is covering feelings & emotions. We want to share our perspectives and resources we've learned from to date

If you have questions about the lesson or want to contribute resources or a layer 2 conversation, please message us on slack

Let's dig in.


------- Teacher perspectives


Ruth:
- I am always looking for the clearest signal and trying to tune into that and simplest path to a high quality experience:  Simplicity and clarity 
- A student of inner world for as long as I can remember having angst and wanting to be able to deal with it - But always same story 
- I know because I read through my old journal's and email conversations and always the same theme, different teachers
- The work of the Heart Math Institute and oddly enough Mark Manson's work is helping to connect the dots with clarit and simplicity
- A huge AHA moment: though we believe it's the logical thinking mind driving the consciousness car, the driver is the feeling/emotional brain
- The thinking brain (the one with the ideas and plans for changing) is in the passenger seat drawing the map of where to go
- But if the feeling brain doesn't like that direction, it will not drive the car there (Mark Manson from book: Everything is F*&..ed - A book about hope)
- The thinking mind and feeling brain speak different languages (thinking = words, feeling brain = signals in body)
- Another big aha moment: Even though I have TONS of tools in the toolbox, this stuck
- Tiny Habits makes perfect sense now: The thinking brain needs to learn to listen closely to the feeling brain, understand its language and know how to negotiate
in order to get the car where it needs to go.
- The Inner Game of Tennis calls these two: Self 1 and Self 2. 

Nick: 
- Growing up in a family that didnt talk about feelings/emotions. False masculinity (boys don't cry or talk about their feelings)
- Most of my life spent ignoring/brushing aside feelings and emotions
- In the past few years have been much more curious about my own feelings and emotions
- Enabled me to observe emotions instead of being controlled by them
- Learning to harness emotions to enhance my life/relationships/creative pursuits


------ Feelings & emotions defined


Distinguish between feelings and emotions

Feelings: Our conscious awareness of the emotions we experience

Emotions: a physiological experience (or state of awareness) that gives us information about the world


------ Emotions & health

How to our emotions affect our overall health (direct and indirect impacts)

Feelings and emotions permeate have a huge impact on our health. Our mental health, our relationships (community)

Health: tuning into our experience and curiously seeking to better understand ourselves

Mindset: all feelings and emotions are important and deserve my attention. Ignoring them comes at a physical and mental cost

Adaptive value of feelings and emotions (if not important, we would not have evolved them)

Pain is always an adaptive signal. Painful emotions are adaptive

Strong emotions are like a wound. Ignore it and it festers. Care for it and it resolves

Unresolved feelings and emotions create a state of dis-ease

Determining when emotions are no longer serving us well. All emotions are valuable, some are useful


------ Emotional intelligence

[Nick]
- Defined: the ability to perceive, use, understand, manage and handle emotions
- Working to better recognize my own emotions allows me to better recognize emotions in others
- People with better emotional intelligence tend to have greater mental health, job performance and leadership skills (able to work with others better)

- Observation: EI is lacking in the health professions. Especially medicine. Barrier to authentic, trusting human to human relationship needed for healing

- Emotion check-in: what am I feeling? [tool: mood meter] why am I feeling it? How long do I want to feel this way for? Is this feeling serving me well?

- Emotional scientist vs. judge

[Ruth]
- When the thinking brain and the feeling body understand each other's languages
- When the thinking brain recognizes the feeling/emotional body as the boss driver of the consciousness car
- and can effectively negotiate with it in order to get the car going in the direction it wants it to go
- When the feeling body is in cahootz with the thinking brain because what they create together is mutually beneficial


------ Expanding feelings vocabulary

- To read a book, I need to have a foundational vocabulary so I can interpret and understand what I'm reading
- To recognize, identify and express my feelings, I need a foundational vocabulary of feelings

- Book: Connect
- Happy, Caring, Depressed, Inadequate, Fearful, Confused, Hurt, Guilt/Shame, Lonely, Angry
- 3 levels of intensity for each (mild, moderate, strong)
- Examples: Happy [glad, cheerful, thrilled], Fearful [nervous, afraid, terrified], Angry [disgusted, offended, enraged]


------ RULER

Great heuristic from Mark Brackett

Recognize emotions in self and others
Understanding the causes and consequences of emotions
Labelling emotions accurately
Expressing emotions appropriately
Regulating emotions effectively


------- Experiments: 

- Write down how you feel right now (min 3 descriptors) 
- Pick someone to go deeper when asked "How are you?"
- Daily emotion entry in health log
- When was the last time you got "stuck" in an argument with someone
- Note a time when you became overwhelmed by an emotion
- Write down 3 people in your life that you feel safe discussing feelings and emotions with
