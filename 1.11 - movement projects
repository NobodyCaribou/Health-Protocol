Intro

Hello beautiful Nerds. Thanks for being here and thanks for making a commitment to your health process

Today Ruth and I are re-introducing movement projects into the 2022 Foot Nerd experience

In previous iterations of the Foot Nerd project, we included projects (positions to reclaim, beam progressions to master, meditation challenge)

Ruth made an observation that we were lacking a movement component in Block 1 so after some discussion we decided to re-introduce a new version of projects

Movement projects are a way to give structure to an underlying aspiration shared by Foot Nerds to restore natural movement patterns and positions

In this brief video, we will be covering:
- The concept of movement projects 
- Why they are important
- Template, not prescription

-------

Concept: 

- Create a new movement objective for yourself with each 60 day block
- Elements: Choosing the objective (motivation? concrete objective, recipe/plan, log data, sharing with partner/pod, debrief)

-------

Why important?

- A structured approach to achieving an objective
- A self directed outlet for play
- An opportunity to witness others and be witnessed by others during the process of working towards goals
- An exercise in setting realistic/concrete objectives, following through with a plan, working through struggle and reflecting 
- A practical application of behaviour design

-------

A template, not a prescription

- Make it your own
- Customize it
- Choose a meaningful objective
- Success based on work done, not the outcome
- It's about learning, not just reaching the objective


Examples:

- Learning an instrument (darbuka drum for me) Recipe: practice at least 5 minutes every morning between 8-9am learning new skills for 30 days. Daily checklist

- Learning to juggle: Objective - be able to juggle for 60 seconds. Recipe: practice every evening before dinner for 5 minutes. Daily checklist

- Beam challenge: Objective - tandem stance for 90 seconds per side. Recipe: daily practice in morning for 5min at least. Test and record weekly. Daily checklist

-------

Ideas to choose from:

> Positions

- Reclaim a resting squat position
- Pistol position


> Skills 

- The squat movement. Do 20 slow, controlled squats every morning with your eyes closed. Simple yet very potent long term
- Juggling. Learn to juggle by practicing 5 minutes two days a week
- Hand blancing. Start with wrist mobility then work on hand balancing progressions
- Single leg balance (amount of time)
- Hanging (amount of time)

> Strength

- Build strength or muscle in a specific area
- Master a loaded movement (kettlebell swing, goblet squats, bottom up press)


> Mobility

- Build up to 5min per side confortably and symmetrically with 90/90 position
- Work towards a heel on the ground squat
- Hand behind back symmetry (scapular position, pec tightness)


-------

NOTES:

Movement projects:

Why?
- Because formalizing movement aspirations increases our accountability for achieving those objectives
- A framework for building movement capacity through playful, self directed experimentation

How?
- With each new block, choose a specific movement project to work on for the next 60 days
- Establish a concrete objective and reason for choosing it
- Create a plan for achieving it
- Build prompts to keep you on track
- take notes in your log
- Share your objective with your partner/pod and seek help from the Nerd community when you face challenges
- Do a project debrief at the end of each block (did you achieve the objective? was it hard or easy? what did you learn from it?)

What?
- A way to hold ourselves and our pod/partners accountable for planning and achieving objectives
- A realistic, concrete movement objective and a detailed plan on how you will work towards achieving it
- Could be a constraint or environment tweak (ex: go 60 days without a couch and log the experiment)


To cover in video:
- What are movement projects?
- Why are they important?
- How do they work?
- A template, not a prescription. Make it your own


Notes:
- Movement projects are about creating a plan for increasing movement capacity with self directed experiments
- Giving structure to the objective of restoring movement
- Fundamentals/foundational skills (foundational capacities like balance, squat position, walking, running, crawling)

Concept: Each nerd chooses a self directed movement project for each block

Pick one thing you want to work on. Why did you choose it? Create a concrete objective

Notes from Ruth: 
- Self directed because each nerd's experience is unique and each human is entering the FNP with a different desired outcomes & experiences.
- Pick on movement project you want to work on
- Could we have more information - like if you can rest for 60 seconds in a deep squat, the following are some projects you could try:
- develop your pistol squat, your ninja beam squat etc
- something with jumping in there, maybe?
- any other
- I'm thinking lists to choose from if they don't have something in mind?

Notes from Nick:
- Create a recipe: when will you work on it?, where will you work on it, what will you work on
- Tell your pod about your project choice (share projects first day of each block) 
- Tell your learning partner your why, your objective and your plan. Hold each other accountable
- Seek guidance from specialists in the Nerd community re: challenges, ideas, torubleshooting
- Create a variety of templates and examples to choose from. Seek feedback and suggestions from Nerds to add to examples
- Each block: New project, renew current project, short debrief in log re: previous project (challenges, observations, insights)
