Movement projects:

Why?
- Because formalizing movement aspirations increases our accountability for achieving those objectives
- A framework for building movement capacity through playful, self directed experimentation

How?
- With each new block, choose a specific movement project to work on for the next 60 days
- Establish a concrete objective and reason for choosing it
- Create a plan for achieving it
- Build prompts to keep you on track
- take notes in your log
- Share your objective with your partner/pod and seek help from the Nerd community when you face challenges
- Do a project debrief at the end of each block (did you achieve the objective? was it hard or easy? what did you learn from it?)

What?
- A way to hold ourselves and our pod/partners accountable for planning and achieving objectives
- A realistic, concrete movement objective and a detailed plan on how you will work towards achieving it
- Could be a constraint or environment tweak (ex: go 60 days without a couch and log the experiment)

- Why are they important?
- How do they work?
- A template, not a prescription. Make it your own



Notes:

Movement projects are about creating a plan for increasing movement capacity with self directed experiments

Giving structure to the 


Fundamentals/foundational skills


Concept: Each nerd chooses a self directed movement project for each block

notes from ruth
-Self directed because each nerd's experience is unique and each human is entering the FNP with a different desired outcomes & experiences.


Pick one thing you want to work on. Why did you choose it? Create a concrete objective
ruth: 
pick on movement project you want to work on
could we have more information - like if you can rest for 60 seconds in a deep squat, the following are some projects you could try:
- develop your pistol squat, your ninja beam squat etc
- something with jumping in there, maybe?
- any other
I'm thinking lists to choose from if they don't have something in mind?

Create a plan: when will you work on it?

Tell your pod about your project choice (share projects first day of each block) 

Tell your learning partner your why, your objective and your plan. Hold each other accountable

Seek guidance from specialists in the Nerd community re: challenges, ideas, torubleshooting

Create a variety of templates and examples to choose from. Seek feedback and suggestions from Nerds to add to examples

Each block: New project, renew current project, short debrief in log re: previous project (challenges, observations, insights)

Examples (categories?, a menu to choose from):

-------> Positions

Reclaim a resting squat position

Pistol position

-------> Skills 

The squat movement. Do 20 slow, controlled squats every morning with your eyes closed. Simple yet very potent long term

Juggling. Learn to juggle by practicing 5 minutes two days a week

Hand blancing. Start with wrist mobility then work on hand balancing progressions

Single leg balance (amount of time)

Hanging (amount of time)

-------> Strength

Build strength or muscle in a specific area

Master a loaded movement (kettlebell swing, goblet squats, bottom up press)

--------> Mobility

Build up to 5min per side confortably and symmetrically with 90/90 position
