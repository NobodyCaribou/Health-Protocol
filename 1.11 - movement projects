Notes:

Concept: Each nerd chooses a self directed movement project for each block

Pick one thing you want to work on. Why did you choose it? Create a concrete objective

Create a plan: when will you work on it?

Tell your pod about your project choice (share projects first day of each block)

Tell your learning partner your why, your objective and your plan. Hold each other accountable

Create a variety of templates and examples to choose from. Seek feedback and suggestions from Nerds to add to examples

Examples (categories?, a menu to choose from):

Positions: reclaim a resting squat position

Skills: Juggling, hand blancing, single leg balance (amount of time), hanging 

Strength: Build strength or muscle in a specific area

Mobility: build up to 5min per side confortably and symmetrically with 90/90 position
