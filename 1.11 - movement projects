Notes:

Concept: Each nerd chooses a self directed movement project for each block

Pick one thing you want to work on. Why did you choose it? Create a concrete objective

Create a plan: when will you work on it?

Tell your pod about your project choice (share projects first day of each block)

Tell your learning partner your why, your objective and your plan. Hold each other accountable

Seek guidance from specialists in the Nerd community re: challenges, ideas, torubleshooting

Create a variety of templates and examples to choose from. Seek feedback and suggestions from Nerds to add to examples

Each block: New project, renew current project, short debrief in log re: previous project (challenges, observations, insights)

Examples (categories?, a menu to choose from):

-------> Positions

Reclaim a resting squat position

Pistol position

-------> Skills 

Juggling

Hand blancing

Single leg balance (amount of time)

Hanging 

-------> Strength

Build strength or muscle in a specific area

--------> Mobility
