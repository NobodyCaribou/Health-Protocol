Lesson Zero (a lesson about creating a lesson)

Teacher (s)

A living document outlining the purpose and structure of a lesson. 

I am a dedicated lifelong learning within the domain of health. 

The unending desire to learn and to share what I've learned has welcomed me to step into the role of teacher. 

Your lesson is your proof of work and opportunity to contribute wisdom to the hive. 

To teach you must understand
With understanding you must craft a lesson. This is your expression of the art of teaching. 

In Tomer's article he mentions that teaching involves 3 elements:

1) Discovering knowledge (through learning and mindful experimentation)
2) Shaping that knowledge into a lesson (Lesson file is ledger of research)
3) Teaching that lesson (primary content - audio)


Consensus lesson guidelines:

- Introduce yourself, share your story
- Principles, not facts
- Inspire critical thinking
- Encourage beautiful disagreements
- How you've applied science to your learning process
- Key insights (moments of truth)
- Experiments (5 to start, tiny to macro - listed in lesson file, mentioned in lesson audio)

Tomers teacher credo:

- I must examine that which has not yet been examined.
- I must also examine that which has been, but not thoroughly enough.
- I must contemplate what I have seen and learned.
- I must try to understand it as clearly as I can.
- I must use reason, intuition, and emotion.

The teachers pledge:

- I will go out into the world and work to learn and discover new knowledge. 
- I will work to distill that knowledge so that others may learn it. 
- I will work to teach that knowledge to others using, as my primary tools, writing and speaking.
