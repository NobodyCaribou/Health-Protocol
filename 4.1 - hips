Framework:
The impact of western culture and the link to hip and knee OA

Greatest factor is sitting. Prolonged sitting leads to:

- Weakened and lengthened glutes
- Shortened hamstrings
- Tightened hip flexors
- Inhibited diaphragm
- Weakened abdominals
- Increased stress on lumbar spine
- Significant decrease in load on feet


What else are we doing differently on a daily basis vs. cultures that are not as reliant on chairs?

- We are driving vs. walking
- We go to the gym vs. daily movement
- High load for short duration: high impact cardio after being stationary most of day
- Living with increased stress which creates tension

Native tribes do not have high rate of OA like western cultures that are sitting in chairs

Ex: Tarahumara still running into 70s, 80s without knee and hip pain

Not normal to require joint replacements at 60-70 years old

--> What does this all mean for the hips? 

- Our hips acclimate to one position: 0-90 degrees. All other postures become very difficult including sleep
- This places stress on other joints like knees (quad dominance) and TS- LS
- Hips lose their mobility, immobility leads to arthritic changes
- Gait pattern changes when we don’t have hip extension

--> Can we entirely blame the hip flexors? 

- Hip flexors are major stabilizing muscle connecting to both hip and lumbar spine, sits in the bowl of the pelvis → organs, diaphragm
- Creates tightness in the hips and the lumbar spine
- Squatting becomes difficult secondary to (lots of things, but…) tight hips that don’t want to go beyond their typical 90 degrees of flexion, as well as 
tightness in the lumbar spine.
- LS flattens, unable to articulate and creates sheering at SIJ and disuse of pelvic rocking APT → PPT
- Hips have difficulty finding extension when hip flexors are shortened, glutes are inhibited
- Adductors become major stabilizer → groin pain and holding tension
- Hamstrings are shortened, increased lordosis (especially in running)

--> Decreased hip extension: it's effect on gait

- Hips do not go beyond neutral → glutes are not being maximized and hip flexors are not being lengthened to max potential → necessary ankle dorsiflexion 
is not being achieved for “normal” gait mechanics → great toe is not being utilized for toe off if it is not behind us
(which creates new gait patterns and eventually pain somewhere up the chain)
- Use it or lose it philosophy → decreased joint ROM → capsular tightness and eventually arthritic changes early
- Cannot access midfoot rocker: progress weight push-off through 1-2 met heads to create stable platform → overusing hip flexors (hip flexor strain), 
stress to knee compartments

--> Foot → Hip connection

- If the foot is not pushing straight through in gait, effect on hip extension and vice versa if hip cannot get hip extension what happens to the back 
and the foot and knee…

Exercise to create mindful hip and foot postural awareness - hip extensions on sliders: https://youtu.be/gzZntMCFqx0

--> Response to load: unsupported sitting and standing 
Use it or lose it – we love load and force. Our bodies enjoy responding to force/load, yet we often adopt “supported” positions which don’t require us 
to utilize our anti-gravity muscles. The more we capitalize on unsupported positions, the more responsive our muscles
	

Hip Normal ROM and Screening:

- Standing Hip Extension 10-30 degrees extension (don't cheat with APT)
- Lumbar spine should remain neutral
- When there is limited hip ROM, generally pelvis or thoracic spine picking up slack
- Poor core stability if inc lumbar lordosis vs hip extension (APT)
- Poor core stab → rib flare → poor diaphragm use


--> Corrective Test: PPT 

2. Squat. Chest forward and upright. Leading with butt, not quad dominant. Core engaged. Corrective: Handheld assisted Squat
3. Thomas Test. Corrective test: Thomas + PPT
4. 90/90 Find your limitations (spine or hip?). Corrective: 90-90 daily 


Experiments

- Squat: 1 minute hold
- Can’t squat yet? Quadruped Rock Backs, Happy Baby, Assisted Squat
- 90 90 on the floor
- Hip CARs

Habit Changes
- Eat 1 meal on the ground daily
- Lie on the floor vs sitting on the couch 
- Sitting Cross Legged to tolerance
