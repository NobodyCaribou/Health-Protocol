------ Intro: [speaker]

Hello beautiful humans

Welcome to lesson 3.5

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

In today's lesson we're unpacking the impacts our environment has on our health

If you have questions about the lesson or want to contribute resources or a layer 2 conversation, please message us on slack

Let's dig in.



------ Defining environment

Fundamental health implication when it comes to environment:

Human biology hasn't changed in the past 1000 years but our environment has changed drastically (workplace, food, technology etc)

Our new alien environment no longer aligns with our biology and is creating obstacles to health

Objective: unpack how our environment shapes our behaviours, become architects of our environment so that it promotes health


Environment: The surroundings or conditions in which a person/animal/plant lives within. The circumstances/objects by which one is surrounded

Environment is like an onion, lot's of layers and dimensions that affect us so we're going to do our best to open up the conversation

Agency: we have control over our environment (tradeoffs)



------ Types of environment

Physical environment: clothing, food, home, workplace, climate, transportation

[home environment covered more in ground living lesson]


Social environment: the people we surround ourselves with (family, friends, coworkers)

Mental environment: the media we're exposed to, positive/negative thoughts



------ Our environment nudges behaviour

We're constantly influenced by our environment. It's the unconscious driver of the choices we make and the habits we form

Environment is the chief determinant of our behaviours

Self awareness: identifying when our environment is working for or against our behaviour change aspirations

Trying to change behaviours without changing the environment they occurr within can be very difficult. Like swimming upstream

Changing our environment to help nudge the behaviour changes we want to make is a much more efficient system



------ Designing our environment

Deliberate (done consciously and intentionally) environment design: creating the environment that nudges healthy behaviours

Don't want to eat junk? Don't have it available

Systems > goals. Designing our environment is creating a system that helps us achieve our goals

James clear: goals are good for planning progress. Systems actually help you MAKE progress

Every 2-3 months when I feel stuck with my daily routine, I make major changes in my environmen and this helps reset my habits

examples: eliminating clutter in home/office, changing phone icons around, changing whiteboard messages

Decision fatigue: deteriorating quality of decisions we make as the number of decisions we make increases. example: end of day snacking

Designing environment: making a 1 time decision that eliminates many other decisions. No couch = no choice to be on ground or couch. only 1 option



------ Subtraction > addition

Less is more

Subtract the sitting furniture and you automatically enhance your movement nutrition without needing to think about it

Remove addictive apps from your phone home screen and you reduce the temptation

Subtract "technology" from your footwear (clothing) and you increase the mobility and load inputs to your feet automatically



------ Epigenetics

The study of how our behaviours and environment can cause changes that affect us at the genetic level

Our environment determines our behaviours. Those inputs affect our biology in profound ways over time

Epi means "above"

Inputs that modify gene activity and expression


------- Experiments: 

- Write down 1 thing you can modify within each type of environment to enhance your health
- Reflection: 5 ways your current home environment nudges habitual behaviours 
- Write down 3 things you want to change in your social environment
- Have a discussion with your learning partner about the impact of our environment on health
- For 2 weeks, track how an environment change you made is affecting your behaviours


------ Outro:

We hope you found this lesson helpful and took some notes in your log
