Let's dig in.



------ Defining environment

The surroundings or conditions in which a person/animal/plant lives within

The circumstances/objects by which one is surrounded

Agency: we have control over our environment (tradeoffs)



------ Types of environment

Physical environment: clothing, food, home, workplace, climate, transportation

[home environment covered more in ground living lesson]


Social environment: the people we surround ourselves with (family, friends, coworkers)

Mental environment: the media we're exposed to, positive/negative thoughts



------ Our environment nudges behaviour

We're constantly influenced by our environment. It's the unconscious driver of the choices we make and the habits we form

Environment is the chief determinant of our behaviours

Self awareness: identifying when our environment is working for or against our behaviour change aspirations



------ Designing our environment

Intentional environment design: creating the environment that nudges healthy behaviours

Don't want to eat junk? Don't have it available

Systems > goals. Designing our environment is creating a system that helps us achieve our goals

James clear: goals are good for planning progress. Systems actually help you MAKE progress

Every 2-3 months when I feel stuck with my daily routine, I make major changes in my environmen and this helps reset my habits

examples: eliminating clutter in home/office, changing phone icons around, changing whiteboard messages



------ Subtraction > addition

Less is more

Subtract the sitting furniture and you automatically enhance your movement nutrition without needing to think about it

Remove addictive apps from your phone home screen and you eliminate the temptation



------ Epigenetics

How the environment influences our genetics



------- Experiments: 

- Write down 1 thing you can modify within each type of environment to enhance your health
- Reflection: 5 ways your current home environment nudges habitual behaviours 
- Write down 3 things you want to change in your social environment

- For 2 weeks, track how an environment change you made is affecting your behaviours
