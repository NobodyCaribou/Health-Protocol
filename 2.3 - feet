The Foot structure
26 bones, 33 joints, 4 layers of muscles, windlass mechanism: rigid lever→ mobile adaptor
Post Tib Tendon: why it’s so important. Nine insertion points on foot, active throughout the stance phase of gait cycle. PTTD can cause: dec B hip ABD torque, dec ABD endurance, dec hip extensor endurance.
Strong medial column will not allow collapse and will maintain neutral hip which allows hip ABD
Plantar fascia valuable elastic spring during running
Rigid footwear effects
MPJ works with medial arch during recoil, may be enhancing propulsion (Arch compression is primary)
Use of rigid orthotics has potential to impair spring function by limiting the max strain that can be developed. 
Orthotics treat symptoms, not the cause. Limited research supports use of orthotics for 3-6 months. What else do we brace in the body?
FDB and FDL decrease torque.
>40 deg dorsiflexion required for running, 45-65 degrees great toe extension
What happens when we don’t have that?
Surgeries at the foot are “symptoms surgeries” generally. Not correcting the “why” which leads to endless surgeries → more immobility
Genetics?
Research shows there is no genetic link other than: hypermobility or joint laxity is hereditary which can lead to greater foot and toe deformities. Research does show that close generations, i.e. mother and daughter will wear similar styles and share postural tendencies.
Effect of traditional footwear / What does current footwear look like
Bunions, hallux valgus, hammertoes (claw, mallet toes), plantar fasciitis, metatarsal pain/injury, neuromas, heel spurs, sesamoiditis, etc.
Shape, heel drop, rigidity and cushion
Natural footwear benefits
Toe splay = can access windlass mechanism aka rigid lever → mobile adaptor
Zero heel drop = no stress on met heads, no shortened Achilles, no excess loads placed anywhere.
Flexible = your feet can feel the ground, can adapt to it properly, which will allow muscles to react as well as sensory feedback to the brain.
Foot Myths: High Arch, Low Arch, Flat foot
All are good, all are normal
What Isn’t Normal in Feet Today?
High rigid arch
Weak collapsed arch
“Top Down, Bottom Up” approach*
Increased hip ER → higher medial tibial stress syndromes
Decreased hip MMT → Higher rate of ITB syndrome in distance runners
Delayed and shorter duration EMG output → Higher rate of PFPS
Injuries to the foot and ankle → Lifestyle limitations for up to 6-18 months post injury →
Increased risk of developing pain or new injury anywhere else in the body
Achilles: Tendons need load. needs to accept up to 12x bodyweight: 11x for running, 5.4x walking → bodyweight calf raises are not enough. ⅔ of the achilles is soleus = power muscle in running * Gait Happens
Ankle Sprains: 40% of ankle sprain patients will experience recurrence. In part due to: protective gait, peroneal muscles inhibited and are no longer pronating → Increased joint inversion at toe off.
Gait??? 
Importance of fascia 30-50% of stress exerted by muscle on tendon may be transmitted to other structures: loose connective tissue, fascia, etc.
If we aren't walking at an optimal step length, we are requiring more work from our muscles and not utilizing the “free energy” that CAN be produced to the fascia/connective tissue.
Why Toe Spacers aren’t cheating, and why they don’t fit in traditional shoes
Experiment: remove shoe insert and outline it on top of piece of paper, remove and stand on top of it with and without toe spacers.
When joints are not aligned properly, muscles cannot engage properly. Toe spacers are usually necessary for proper re-ed of intrinsic muscles.
