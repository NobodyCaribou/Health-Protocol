------ Intro: [speaker]

Hello beautiful humans

Welcome to lesson 3.3

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

In this lesson we're covering food

If you have questions about the lesson or want to contribute resources or a layer 2 conversation, please message us on slack

Let's dig in.



------ Food: defined

What is food? Definition: any nutritious substance consumed that are absorbed in order to maintain life and growth

Real food: substances created by nature that our human biology is designed to digest

Energy (calories/fuel) and nutrients (information)

Food is information, not just nutrients. A set of programming instructions our body uses

Food vs. food like products

Life eats life

Alive (high vibration) food vs dead (low vibration) food

Great book exerpt from "food fix" by Dr Mark Hyman that articulates the importance of food literacy at many levels:


“Our diet is the number one cause of death, disability and suffering in the world. 

Our food has dramatically transformed over the last 100 years, and even more radically over the last 40 years, 
as we have eaten a diet of increasingly ultra processed foods made from a handful of crops (wheat, corn, soy). 

If poor diet is the biggest killer on the planet, I was forced to ask, what is the cause of our food problem and the system that produces it? 

This led to a deep exploration of the entire food chain, from seed to field to fork to landfill, and the harm caused at each step of the journey. 

The story of food shocked me, frightened me, and drove me to tell this story and to find the possibility of redemption from the broken 
system that is slowly destroying the people and things we love most. 

Food is our most powerful tool to reverse the global epidemic of chronic disease, heal the environment, reverse climate change, 
end poverty and social injustice, reform politics, and revive economies is food. The food we grow, how we grow it, 
and the food we eat have tremendous implications not just for our waistlines but also for our communities, the planet and the global economy. 

Chronic disease is now the single biggest threat to global economic development. 

Lifestyle-caused diseases like heart disease, diabetes and cancer now kill nearly 50 million people a year, more than twice as many as die from infectious disease

Two billion people go to bed overweight and 800 million to go bed hungry in their world today

One in two Americans and one in four teenagers have pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes.”

Powerful words to reinforce our sense of purpose when it comes to the potential of food to change the world 

[Ruth]
- In addition to the hard scientific definition of food, but the softer definition of food as a social, communal construct
- The fabric of sharing meals and its effect on our digestion and overall health

------ We are what we eat

We are what we eat, and what we eat ate, and what they ate....etc

Food as the building blocks and base repair elements for our bodies

Food as catalysts for important bodily reactions

Quality of food cannot be disconnected from the quality of the environment which created the food

[Ruth]
- we are also "how" we eat
- fast, slow, alone, with other
- state of mind - calm, stressed, happy, sad
- with ceremony and ritual or hurried and indifferent

------ Food principles

Eat real food (let nature provide, grow something)

Not too much

Mostly plants

The longer the ingredient list, the less likely it is to be real food

If it comes in packaging and lasts a long time, it's low vibration food (not even microbes want to eat it)

[Ruth]
- the learning curve and the pendulum swinging from super vigilant and practice oriented
- rehabbing a kitchen is fun and empowering
- revamping our mouths and nervous systems to enjoy real food takes a few weeks depending on how adulterated our diets are
- takes some time and attention and there are some tricks to weaning and reclaiming the original pleasures of eating whole foods


------ Unlearning nutrition

Misplaced precision

Simple is better. Unlearn nutrition, re-learn food

Nutritionism: the scientifically identified nutrients in foods determine the value of foods. The value of food is simply the sum of its constituent nutrients

Confusing people is how you trick them. Real food is no longer as good as engineered, processed foods with certain nutrients

Nutritional science is very young, usually wrong and used as a marketing tool for processed foods



------ Fasting

Powerful force for healing, allowing the body time to reset

Hunger vs. actual hunger. Usually a habit, not a physical need.

Internal cues (feeling hungry or full) vs. external cues (smelling food, seeing a food ad, eating until plate is empty) [soup experiment, amount of soup eaten]


Constantly eating is unnatural for our biology

Time restricted eating, short to long duration fasting

My routine: eating once a day, sometimes with an afternoon snack



------ Biology > Ideology

Eat according to your biology, not an ideological dogma

What works for you probably wont have the exact same result for me

Biological constraints are super wide and varied

Ideologies: vegan, carnivore, paleo, vegetarian. Experiment but don't be rigid

Introducing morality into food is a slippery slope

Life eats life

Not about the cow, it's about the how

[Ruth]
- when it comes to this topic, it seems to me, the one where truly experimenting is necessary and to tune out the noise of ideology 
- truly keep it simple and understand what will most likely happen (a detox effect and food not tasting great intitially)
- but will depend on the how you're eating now regularly


------ Feedback signals

Tune into how you feel. Food journal helps detect patterns

Connect what you ate with how you feel

Your energy levels, your mental focus, cramps/bloating, your poop, soreness

Identifying cravings and being curious about using food as a soothing substance


------- Experiments: 

Experiment a lot. Be mindful and log data

- Log 3 personal food objectives
- Log what you eat for 7 days
- Reflect on your relationship with food
- Grow some food
- Fasting challenge
- Cook a meal from scratch
- Log food cravings
- Clean up your home food environment

[Ruth}
-eat a meal with other people - no talking, no screens, turn on some calming music without lyrics
- reflect in your health log about the experience and the feelings you felt



------ Outro:

We hope you found this lesson helpful and took some notes in your log

Listening to this is proof of work

Thank you for taking responsibility for your health and we hope you connect with your learning partner and podmates to discuss what we covered in this lesson

Ciao for now friends
