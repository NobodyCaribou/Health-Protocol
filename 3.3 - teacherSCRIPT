------ Intro: [speaker]

Hello beautiful humans

Welcome to lesson 3.3

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

In this lesson we're covering food

If you have questions about the lesson or want to contribute resources or a layer 2 conversation, please message us on slack

Let's dig in.



------ Food: defined

What is food?

Food vs. food like products

Life eats life

Alive (high vibration) food vs dead (low vibration) food

Food is information, not just nutrients. A set of programming instructions our body uses


------ We are what we eat

We are what we eat, and what we eat ate, and what they ate....etc

Food as the building blocks and base repair elements for our bodies

Food as catalysts for important bodily reactions

Quality of food cannot be disconnected from the quality of the environment which created the food


------ Food principles

Eat real food (let nature provide, grow something)

Not too much

Mostly plants

The longer the ingredient list, the less likely it is to be real food

If it comes in packaging and lasts a long time, it's low vibration food (not even microbes want to eat it)


------ Unlearning nutrition

Misplaced precision

Simple is better. Unlearn nutrition, re-learn food

Nutritionism: the scientifically identified nutrients in foods determine the value of foods. The value of food is simply the sum of its constituent nutrients

Confusing people is how you trick them. Real food is no longer as good as engineered, processed foods with certain nutrients

Nutritional science is very young, usually wrong and used as a marketing tool for processed foods



------ Fasting

Powerful force for healing, allowing the body time to reset

Hunger vs. actual hunger. Usually a habit, not a physical need

Constantly eating is unnatural for our biology

Time restricted eating, short to long duration fasting

My routine: eating once a day, sometimes with an afternoon snack


------ Biology > Ideology

Eat according to your biology, not an ideological dogma

What works for you probably wont have the exact same result for me

Biological constraints are super wide and varied

Ideologies: vegan, carnivore, paleo, vegetarian. Experiment but don't be rigid

Introducing morality into food is a slippery slope

Life eats life

Not about the cow, it's about the how


------ Feedback signals

Tune into how you feel. Food journal helps detect patterns

Connect what you ate with how you feel

Your energy levels, your mental focus, cramps/bloating, your poop, soreness

Identifying cravings and being curious about using food as a soothing substance


------- Experiments: 

Experiment a lot. Be mindful and log data

- Log 3 personal food objectives
- Log what you eat for 7 days
- Reflect on your relationship with food
- Grow some food
- Fasting challenge
- Cook a meal from scratch
- Log food cravings
- Clean up your home food environment


------ Outro:

We hope you found this lesson helpful and took some notes in your log

Listening to this is proof of work

Thank you for taking responsibility for your health and we hope you connect with your learning partner and podmates to discuss what we covered in this lesson

Ciao for now friends
