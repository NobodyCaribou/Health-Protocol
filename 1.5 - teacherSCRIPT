Let's dig in.


Context:

Important point: Bitcoin must not be conflated with crypto. They are fundamentally different things

Bitcoin is an open, decentralized, global network that supports mathematically engineered money that anyone on earth can use without asking permission

Crypto is the wild world of fintech startups. 95% of them are scams, some are interesting but none have yet solved meaningful problems

Bitcoin solves a major problem we all face: how do we store our time within a money that preserves our energy that cannot be corrupted



Two parallel interests in my life for the past 5 years: health and bitcoin

At the start of this year those two interests converged when I realized that broken money (fiat) is our primary obstacle to health as a human collective



------ The keystone pillar

Keystone: of crucial importance (the apex stone in masonry that holds everything together)

From my perspective, financial literacy is the gatekeeper element to health so I'm going to to my best at explaining the rationale that gets me there


------ What is money?

Tokenized time

Refer to Bitcoin stoa podcast: what is money? first principles


------ Health requires time

If time is being stolen from us, little is left for health

Time to understand what health means to us, time to explore and experiment so we can make productive changes to improve our health


------ Fiat debasement

Creating more money makes the money you own less valuable

A form of taxation that most people are not aware of

How we feel it: "the squeeze"


------ Bitcoin protects your time

Engineered money nobody controls

Solved the fiat problems by taking the humans out of it

Replaced central banks with a protocol we all agree is fair


------- Experiments: 

- What is your current understanding of money?
- How does money impact your life?
- Is money a source of stress in your life?
- Have a conversation about money with someone
- Download a bitcoin wallet and buy $20 worth of bitcoin. Send $5 to your learning partner and have them send it back
