Lesson 2.5 - Game theory of health

------ Intro: [Ruth]
Hello Friends, Welcome to lesson 2.5 - The game theory of health
By now you've had some time with the material. You know us, Ruth & Nick. 

- thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health
- we welcome you to lesson 2.5 - game theory of health
- today's objective is to unpack the idea of game theory as you explore what it means to give your body the best possible inputs for better health
- we make a case for the importance of understanding the definition of game theory as it relates to health and medicine in the big institutional sense 
- and how you can use your curiosity and knowledge as empowerment in the increasing confusion of the healthcare landscape

- as always, if you have questions about the lesson, feel free to message us on Slack

Let's dig in.

Framework:
------what is game theory? 
- why are we talking about it?
- what does it have to do with taking responsibility for our health?

definition:
Here is a description of game theory that helped me get a basic overview of the concept
- the science of logical decision making
- game theory is the mathematical study of strategic decision making
- the mechanics of game theory have these criteria
1. a game includes more than 2 players
2. the players need to interact with each other
3. there needs to be a reward
4. we assume that players act rationally
5. we assume that players act according to their self interest

-initially applied to politics, economics and sports and further expanded to sciences

extra notes for Ruth:
- any interaction between multiple people in which the player's payoff is affected by the decision of the others
- any single interaction you are a part of can be analyzed with game theory in order to produce the most beneficial outcome
-the science of logical decision making

[Ruth asks Nick]: 
- What does game theory have to do with our health and the systems giving care to our population of humans?

----definition of game theory of health:
[Nick]

[Ruth Notes]
ask NickyPoP to:
identify and define the current players, the incentive, the rules of sick care system
identify the possibilities for shifting the incentives to favor healthy living support and disease prevention

[Ruth's Question for Nick]
- what role do you think we, as individuals, have in the game theory of sickcare? 

[Extra Notes from Ruth so Nick knows why I have the question above]
- I was thingking we are players in the game, right?
- if we accept the notion that we are players in the game of this current system:
- then we have agency to create strategies for ourselves and that would require us, as individuals, to accept responsibility for being players/actors
in the game theory of health
- I was listening to talk about game theory where the speaker cites that Plato recalls the battle of Delium in  424 BC and how this may have been the 1st mention of game theory
- consider a soldier in the front line having the realization that "if our defense is successful, i still risk dying"
- and "if our defense is unsuccessful, I almost certainly will die"
- based on this reasoning, it seems the best strategy is to run away regardless of who is going to win the battle
- and then what if all the soldiers, both Athenians and Boetians, realized that they would all be better off running away?

- and that got me wondering from the perspective of the "patients" or us as a population and how we interact with the game of sickcare


----- outcomes follow incentives [Nick]


----- sickcare system
[Ruth] 
- we have a medical (that is, sick) care system
- a system that waits until we become ill before it kicks into action
[Nick]




------ mis-aligned incentives 
[Nick]

[Ruth] 
- example of mis-aligned incentive from personal experience:
- going to doc for routine check up and blood lab work
- perfectly healthy 28 year old - absolutely nothing to report on my health intake form except:
- left with a prescription from doc for Wellbutrin because I answered that I smoked a cigarrette from time to time when out with friends
Common side effects of Wellbutrin:

Symptoms of anxiety
Agitation
Tinnitus
Pharyngitis
Xerostomia
Constipation
Arthralgia
Concentration difficulty
Dizziness
Insomnia
Hyperhidrosis
Tremor
Anorexia
Weight loss
Palpitations
Nausea
Diarrhea
Acute abdominal pain
Nervousness
Dream disorder
Tell your doctor right away if any of these unlikely but serious side effects occur

Chest pain
Fainting
Fast/pounding/irregular heartbeat
Hearing problems
Ringing in the ears
Severe headache
Mental/mood changes
Uncontrolled movements
Unusual weight loss or gain
Tell your doctor right away if any of these rare but very serious side effects occur

Muscle pain/tenderness/weakness
Get medical help right away if you have any very serious side effects, including

Eye pain/swelling/redness
Widened pupils
Vision changes
A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is unlikely, but seek immediate medical attention if it occurs. 
Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction include
Rash
Itching/swelling
Severe dizziness
Trouble breathing
Other things to note



------ creating a new health system with aligned incentives
[Nick]

[Ruth] 
- our role as individuals is to take the initiative to understand the changing landscape of medicine systems
- and how we as individuals choose to participate in the game


------ legacy medicine
[Ruth]
- definition of a legacy system:
- referring to any given older outdated system that could be considered for replacement by something 
that meets the current needs of  the organization
[Nick expands]




------lesson 2.5 Experiments:

1. begin a discussion in your class Slack channel with your podmates about examples of game theory in general (example: rock, paper, scissors)
2. turn the discussion to the game theory of health and unpack examples in your log and/or discuss with your learning partner to be sure you understand




------ Outro:

We hope you found this lesson helpful and took some notes in your log.

Listening to this is proof of work. 

Thank you for taking responsibility for your health and we hope you have a spunky conversation with your podmates about game theory and health

Ciao for now friends
