Let's dig in.

Framework:
------what is game theory? Why are we talking about it and what does it have to do with taking responsibility for our health?

definition:
Here is a description of game theory that helped me get a basic overview of the concept
- the science of logical decision making
- game theory is the mathematical study of strategic decision making
- the mechanics of game theory have these criteria
1. a game includes more than 2 players
2. the players need to interact with each other
3. there needs to be a reward
4. we assume that players act rationally
5. we assume that players act according to their self interest

-initially applied to politics, economics and sports and further expanded to sciences

extra notes for Ruth:
- any interaction between multiple people in which the player's payoff is affected by the decision of the others
- any single interaction you are a part of can be analyzed with game theory in order to produce the most beneficial outcome
-the science of logical decision making
