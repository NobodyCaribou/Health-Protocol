Framework:
------what is game theory?

definition:
- a "game" in game theory is any interaction between multiple people in which the player's payoff is affected
by the decision of the others
- any single interaction you are a part of can be analyzed with game theory in order to produce the most beneficial outcome
-the science of logical decision making
-game theory is the mathematical study of strategic decision making

2. the players need to interact with each other
3. there needs to be a reward
4. we assume that players act rationally
5. we assume that players act according to their self interest
-initially applied to politics, economics and sports and further expanded to sciences

Ruth asks Nick: Based on the definition of game theory, in general, can you define "game theory" as it relates to our 
institutions currently that provide care?
